/**
 * <p>Sets the retention of the specified log group. With a retention policy, you can
 *       configure the number of days for which to retain log events in the specified log
 *       group.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>CloudWatch Logs doesn’t immediately delete log events when they reach their retention
 *         setting. It typically takes up to 72 hours after that before log events are deleted, but in
 *         rare situations might take longer.</p>
 *             <p>To illustrate, imagine that you change a log group to have a longer retention setting
 *         when it contains log events that are past the expiration date, but haven’t been deleted.
 *         Those log events will take up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is
 *         reached. To make sure that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower
 *         retention setting until 72 hours after the previous retention period ends. Alternatively,
 *         wait to change the retention setting until you confirm that the earlier log events are
 *         deleted. </p>
 *             <p>When log events reach their retention setting they are marked for deletion. After
 *         they are marked for deletion, they do not add to your archival storage costs anymore, even if
 *         they are not actually deleted until later. These log events marked for deletion are also not
 *         included when you use an API to retrieve the <code>storedBytes</code> value to see how many bytes a log group is storing.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudWatchLogsClient, PutRetentionPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudWatchLogsClient, PutRetentionPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudWatchLogsClient(config);
 * const input = { // PutRetentionPolicyRequest
 *   logGroupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   retentionInDays: Number("int"), // required
 * };
 * const command = new PutRetentionPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param PutRetentionPolicyCommandInput - {@link PutRetentionPolicyCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link PutRetentionPolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link PutRetentionPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutRetentionPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudWatchLogsClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudWatchLogsClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A parameter is specified incorrectly.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OperationAbortedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Multiple concurrent requests to update the same resource were in conflict.</p>
