/**
 * <p>You can retry a stage that has failed without having to run a pipeline again from
 *             the beginning. You do this by either retrying the failed actions in a stage or by
 *             retrying all actions in the stage starting from the first action in the stage. When you
 *             retry the failed actions in a stage, all actions that are still in progress continue
 *             working, and failed actions are triggered again. When you retry a failed stage from the
 *             first action in the stage, the stage cannot have any actions in progress. Before a stage
 *             can be retried, it must either have all actions failed or some actions failed and some
 *             succeeded.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CodePipelineClient, RetryStageExecutionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-codepipeline"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CodePipelineClient, RetryStageExecutionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-codepipeline"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CodePipelineClient(config);
 * const input = { // RetryStageExecutionInput
 *   pipelineName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   stageName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   pipelineExecutionId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   retryMode: "FAILED_ACTIONS" || "ALL_ACTIONS", // required
 * };
 * const command = new RetryStageExecutionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // RetryStageExecutionOutput
 * //   pipelineExecutionId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param RetryStageExecutionCommandInput - {@link RetryStageExecutionCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link RetryStageExecutionCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link RetryStageExecutionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link RetryStageExecutionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CodePipelineClientResolvedConfig | config} for CodePipelineClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Your request cannot be handled because the pipeline is busy handling ongoing
 *             activities. Try again later.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotLatestPipelineExecutionException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The stage has failed in a later run of the pipeline and the
 *                 <code>pipelineExecutionId</code> associated with the request is out of
 *             date.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PipelineNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The pipeline was specified in an invalid format or cannot be found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link StageNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The stage was specified in an invalid format or cannot be found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link StageNotRetryableException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Unable to retry. The pipeline structure or stage state might have changed while
 *             actions awaited retry, or the stage contains no failed
 *             actions.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The validation was specified in an invalid format.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link CodePipelineServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from CodePipeline service.</p>
