/**
 * <p>The cause of this error depends on whether you're trying to create a public or a private hosted zone:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Public hosted zone:</b> Two hosted zones that have the same name or that have a parent/child relationship (example.com and test.example.com) can't have any common name servers. You tried to create a hosted zone that has the same name as an existing hosted zone or that's the parent or child of an existing hosted zone, and you specified a delegation set that shares one or more name servers with the existing hosted zone. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReusableDelegationSet.html">CreateReusableDelegationSet</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Private hosted zone:</b> You specified an Amazon VPC that you're already using for another hosted zone, and the domain that you specified for one of the hosted zones is a subdomain of the domain that you specified for the other hosted zone. For example, you can't use the same Amazon VPC for the hosted zones for example.com and test.example.com.</p> </li> </ul>
