 *          <p>
 *             <b>Overview</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
 *         Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the
 *       administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning
 *       and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any
 *       type of application or backend service. For more information about the Lambda service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What is Lambda</a> in the <b>Lambda Developer Guide</b>.</p>
 *          <p>The <i>Lambda API Reference</i> provides information about
 *       each of the API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and
 *       response. </p>
 *          <p></p>
 *          <p>You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command
 *       line tools to access the API. For installation instructions, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for
 *         Amazon Web Services</a>. </p>
 *          <p>For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports,
 *       see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/">Lambda
 *         endpoints and quotas </a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference.</i>. </p>
 *          <p>When making the API calls, you will need to
 *       authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information,
 *       see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 signing process</a> in the
 *       <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference.</i>. </p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>CA certificates</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Because Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers
 *         can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your
 *         computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate
 *         environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the
 *         update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one
 *             of the required CAs in their trust list. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and
 *             later versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the
 *             required CAs in their default trusted CA list. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December
 *             2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list. </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>When accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or
 *         programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following CAs: </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Amazon Root CA 1</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/">Amazon trust services</a>, but keeping your computer
 *         up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM-provided certificates, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/faqs/#certificates">Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager FAQs.</a>
