/**
 * <p>This is the API Reference Guide for the zonal shift feature of Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about
 * 			zonal shift API actions, data types, and errors.</p>
 * 		       <p>Zonal shift is in preview release for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller and is subject to change.</p>
 * 		       <p>Zonal shift in Route 53 ARC enables you to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability Zone. Starting
 * 			a zonal shift helps your application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code deployment
 * 			or from an AWS infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone, reducing the impact and time lost from an issue
 * 			in one zone. </p>
 * 		       <p>Supported AWS resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC. Resources that are registered for zonal shifts
 * 			in Route 53 ARC are managed resources in Route 53 ARC. You can start a zonal shift for any managed resource in your account in a Region.
 * 			At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.</p>
 * 		       <p>Zonal shifts are temporary. You must specify an expiration when you start a zonal shift, of up to three days initially.
 * 			If you want to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone, you can update the zonal shift and set a new expiration.
 * 			You can also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone.</p>
 * 		       <p>For more information about using zonal shift, see the
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide</a>.</p>
