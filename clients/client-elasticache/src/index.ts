 * <fullname>Amazon ElastiCache</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate,
 *             and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.</p>
 *          <p>With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance,
 *             in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache.
 *             The service makes setup, scaling,
 *             and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.</p>
 *          <p>In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch,
 *             customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics
 *             associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.</p>
