 * <fullname>Amazon ElastiCache</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale
 *             a distributed cache in the cloud.</p>
 *          <p>With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory
 *             cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and managing a
 *             distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much
 *             simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.</p>
 *          <p>In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced
 *             visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and can
 *             receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.</p>
