## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript IoTAnalytics Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>AWS IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process messages, and store them.
You can then query the data and run sophisticated analytics on it.  AWS IoT Analytics enables advanced
data exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration
with Amazon QuickSight.</p>

<p>Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data
often comes from devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result
the data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be
cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data
from external sources. </p>

<p>AWS IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. AWS IoT Analytics
filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You
can set up the service to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms
to process the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location
before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine,
or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. AWS IoT Analytics includes pre-built models
for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are about to fail or which customers
are at risk of abandoning their wearable devices.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-iotanalytics
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-iotanalytics`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-iotanalytics`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-iotanalytics`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `IoTAnalyticsClient` and
the commands you need, for example `BatchPutMessageCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { IoTAnalyticsClient, BatchPutMessageCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iotanalytics");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { IoTAnalyticsClient, BatchPutMessageCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iotanalytics";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new IoTAnalyticsClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new BatchPutMessageCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-iotanalytics";
const client = new AWS.IoTAnalytics({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.batchPutMessage(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .batchPutMessage(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.batchPutMessage(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
