 * <fullname>App Runner</fullname>
 *          <p>App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code
 *       to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to
 *       provision and configure Amazon Web Services resources.</p>
 *          <p>App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations,
 *       high performance, scalability, and security.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about App Runner, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/">App Runner Developer Guide</a>.
 *       For release information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/">App Runner Release Notes</a>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *        To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated
 *       Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for
