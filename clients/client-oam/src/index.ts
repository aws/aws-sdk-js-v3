/**
 * <p>Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links between source accounts and
 *       monitoring accounts by using <i>CloudWatch cross-account observability</i>. With
 *         CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span
 *       multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics,
 *       logs, traces, and Application Insights applications in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries.</p>
 *          <p>Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as <i>monitoring
 *         accounts</i> and link them with multiple <i>source accounts</i>. A
 *       monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with
 *       observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates observability data for the resources that reside in it.
 *       Source accounts share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared
 *       observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, traces in X-Ray, and applications in Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights.</p>
