/**
 * <p>Disconnect a Recovery Instance from Elastic Disaster Recovery. Data replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources created by Elastic Disaster Recovery for enabling the replication of the Recovery Instance will be terminated / deleted within 90 minutes. If the agent on the Recovery Instance has not been prevented from communicating with the Elastic Disaster Recovery service, then it will receive a command to uninstall itself (within approximately 10 minutes). The following properties of the Recovery Instance will be changed immediately: dataReplicationInfo.dataReplicationState will be set to DISCONNECTED; The totalStorageBytes property for each of dataReplicationInfo.replicatedDisks will be set to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration and dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { DrsClient, DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-drs"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { DrsClient, DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-drs"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new DrsClient(config);
 * const input = { // DisconnectRecoveryInstanceRequest
 *   recoveryInstanceID: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommandInput - {@link DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DisconnectRecoveryInstanceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link DrsClientResolvedConfig | config} for DrsClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient access to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception or failure.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource for this operation was not found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to request throttling.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link UninitializedAccountException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The account performing the request has not been initialized.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link DrsServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from Drs service.</p>
