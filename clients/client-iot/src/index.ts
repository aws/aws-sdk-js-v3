 * <fullname>IoT</fullname>
 *          <p>IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected
 *             devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services
 *             cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure
 *             rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources
 *             associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage
 *             policies and credentials to authenticate devices.</p>
 *          <p>The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html">Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas</a>.
 *             You must use the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access.</p>
 *          <p>The service name used by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon Web Services
 *                 Signature Version 4</a> to sign the request is:
 *             <i>execute-api</i>.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about how IoT works, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html">Developer
 *             Guide</a>.</p>
