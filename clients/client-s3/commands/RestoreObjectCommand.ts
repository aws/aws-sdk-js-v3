 *                <p>
 *                   <code>select</code> - Perform a select query on an archived object</p>

 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the

 *             <b>Querying Archives with Select Requests</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The
 *          archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as
 *          uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics
 *          on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an
 *          overview about select requests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>When making a select request, do the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3
 *                bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is
 *                being queried. The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write
 *                to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output
 *                objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html">Querying Archived Objects</a>

 *                      <p>

 *                      specify headers in the query. (If you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> field
 *                      to <code>IGNORE</code>, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix
 *                      ordinal positions with header column names. </p>
 *                      <p>
 *                         <code>SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s</code>

 *          <p>When making a select request, you can also do the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>To expedite your queries, specify the <code>Expedited</code> tier. For more
 *                information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.</p>
 *             </li>

 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>The following are additional important facts about the select feature:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are
 *                stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't
 *                deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p> Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A
 *                select request doesnâ€™t return error response <code>409</code>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Restoring objects</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or
 *          S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or
 *          S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in
 *          Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and
 *          then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in
 *          S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must
 *          first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is
 *          available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration
 *          (number of days) that you specify.</p>
 *          <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide
 *          a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p>
 *          <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of
 *          the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request
 *          body: </p>
 *          <ul>

 *                      <code>Expedited</code>
 *                   </b> - Expedited retrievals
 *                allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier
 *                storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a
 *                subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+),
 *                data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1â€“5
 *                minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited
 *                retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned
 *                capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive

 *                option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard
 *                retrievals typically finish within 3â€“5 hours for objects stored in the
 *                S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They
 *                typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the

 *          <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed

 *             <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p>
 *          <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request.
 *          Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about
 *          the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you

 *          the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
 *          the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current
 *          time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot
 *          update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request
 *          for the object.</p>
 *          <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
 *          action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
 *          request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
 *          scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
 *          about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in
