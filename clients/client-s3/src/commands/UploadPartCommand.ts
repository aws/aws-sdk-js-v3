/**
 * Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
 *
 * > **Note:** In this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) operation.
 *
 * You must initiate a multipart upload (see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request.
 *
 * Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.
 *
 * For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see [Multipart upload limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
 *
 * > **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.
 *
 * For more information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
 *
 * > **Note:** **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name`. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
 *
 * - **Permissions**
 *
 *   - **General purpose bucket permissions** - To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the `kms:GenerateDataKey` action for the `CreateMultipartUpload` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the `kms:Decrypt` action on the `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` APIs.
 *
 *     These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS permissions, see [Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart upload and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html) and [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
 *   - **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html).
 *
 *     If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.
 *
 * - **Data integrity**
 *
 *   **General purpose bucket** - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, specify the `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum instead of `Content-MD5`. For more information see [Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html).
 *
 *   > **Note:** **Directory buckets** - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use checksum algorithms to check object integrity.
 *
 * - **Encryption**
 *
 *   - **General purpose bucket** - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C).
 *
 *     Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload operations. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html).
 *
 *     > **Note:** If you have server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) blocked for your general purpose bucket, you will get an HTTP 403 Access Denied error when you specify the SSE-C request headers while writing new data to your bucket. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.html).
 *
 *     If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following request headers.
 *
 *     - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
 *     - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
 *     - x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
 *
 *     For more information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
 *   - **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (`AES256`) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (`aws:kms`).
 *
 * - **Special errors**
 *
 *   - Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`
 *
 *     - Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.
 *     - HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found
 *     - SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client
 *
 * - **HTTP Host header syntax**
 *
 *   **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is `Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.
 *
 * The following operations are related to `UploadPart`:
 *
 * - [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)
 * - [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html)
 * - [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html)
 * - [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html)
 * - [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html)
 *
 * > **Important:** You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
