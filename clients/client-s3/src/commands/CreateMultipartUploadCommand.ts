 *             <p>After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for
 *         storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the

 *          </note>
 *          <p>If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the created multipart
 *       upload must be completed within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration.
 *       Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the

Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token for use.
 * Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html">

 *                         <b>General purpose buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for
 *                 data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers
 *                 and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are
 *                 uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption
 *                 information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the
 *                 default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a
 *                 base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
 *                 (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses
 *                 server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided
 *                 encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to
 *                 encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to
 *                 use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3
 *                 encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key,
 *                 or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from the
 *                 default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your
 *                 request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request
 *                 headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the

For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html">Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads</a>.</p>
 *                      <p>In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html">CopyObject</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a>) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the <code>CreateSession</code> request.
 *                             You can't override the values of the encryption settings (<code>x-amz-server-side-encryption</code>, <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code>, and <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled</code>) that are specified in the <code>CreateSession</code> request.
 *                             You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and
 *                             Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the <code>CreateSession</code> request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.
 *                            </p>
 *                      <note>
 *                         <p>When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for <code>CreateSession</code>, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the
 *                             <code>CreateSession</code> request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the <code>CreateSession</code> request.
 *                             So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html">CopyObject</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a>),
 *           the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.

 *                      <note>
 *                         <p>For directory buckets, when you perform a <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code> operation
 *                   and an <code>UploadPartCopy</code> operation, the request headers you provide in the
 *                     <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code> request must match the default encryption configuration
 *                   of the destination bucket. </p>
