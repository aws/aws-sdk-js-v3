 * Creates or modifies `OwnershipControls` for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the `s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see [Specifying permissions in a policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/using-with-s3-actions.html).

 * The following operations are related to `PutBucketOwnershipControls`:
 *
 * - GetBucketOwnershipControls
 * - DeleteBucketOwnershipControls
 *
 * > **Important:** You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
 *
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { S3Client, PutBucketOwnershipControlsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { S3Client, PutBucketOwnershipControlsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { S3ClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
 * const config = {}; // type is S3ClientConfig
 * const client = new S3Client(config);
 * const input = { // PutBucketOwnershipControlsRequest
 *   Bucket: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ContentMD5: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ExpectedBucketOwner: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   OwnershipControls: { // OwnershipControls
 *     Rules: [ // OwnershipControlsRules // required
