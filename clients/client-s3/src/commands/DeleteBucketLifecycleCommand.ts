 *                 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example,
 *                 lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the
 *                 Amazon Web Services account that created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally
 *                 grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user
 *                 must have the <code>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> permission.</p>
