 *          <p>There are two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more information about

 *             request goes to the <code>us-east-1</code> Region. So the signature calculations in Signature
 *             Version 4 must use <code>us-east-1</code> as the Region, even if the location constraint in the
 *             request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a
 *             Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For

 *                         <code>BucketOwnerEnforced</code>. Additionally, if your desired bucket ACL grants
 *                       public access, you must first create the bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then
 *                       explicitly disable Block Public Access on the bucket before using
 *                         <code>PutBucketAcl</code> to set the ACL. If you try to create a bucket with a public
