   *             <b>Access points</b> - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name.

   *                   <b>Directory buckets </b> -
   *           For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (<code>AES256</code>) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (<code>aws:kms</code>). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your
   *             <code>CreateSession</code> requests or <code>PUT</code> object requests. Then, new objects
   *  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more
   *          information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting data with server-side encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html">Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads</a>. </p>
   *                <p>In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html">CopyObject</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a>) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the <code>CreateSession</code> request.
   *                             You can't override the values of the encryption settings (<code>x-amz-server-side-encryption</code>, <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code>, and <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled</code>) that are specified in the <code>CreateSession</code> request.
   *                             You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and
   *                             Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the <code>CreateSession</code> request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.
   *                            </p>
   *                <note>
   *                   <p>When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for <code>CreateSession</code>, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the
   *                             <code>CreateSession</code> request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the <code>CreateSession</code> request.
   *                             So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html">CopyObject</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a>),
   *           the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.
