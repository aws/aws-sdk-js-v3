/**
 * <p>Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access risks by enabling you to
 *          identify any policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using
 *          logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment. An
 *          external principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a
 *          federated user, an Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to
 *          preview and validate public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying
 *          permissions changes. This guide describes the Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer operations that you can
 *          call programmatically. For general information about IAM Access Analyzer, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer</a> in the <b>IAM User Guide</b>.</p>
 *          <p>To start using IAM Access Analyzer, you first need to create an analyzer.</p>
