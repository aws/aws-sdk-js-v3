 * <p>Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access
 *             to internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single step, your users, such as
 *             employees, can access internal websites as efficiently as they access any other public website.
 *             They enter a URL in their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email. Amazon WorkLink
 *             authenticates the user's access and securely renders authorized internal web content in a secure
 *             rendering service in the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content on
 *             mobile devices.</p>
