/**
 * <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to
 *     		your snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between
 *     		two snapshots. If youâ€™re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for
 *     		Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and cost-effective to track incremental changes on
 *     		your Amazon EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
 *     		from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the differences.</p>
 *          <p>You can create incremental snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the
 *     		cloud to use for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots, you can
 *     		write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then after recovery, you can
 *     		restore it back to Amazon Web Services or on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and
 *     		maintain complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p>
 *          <p>This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
 *             parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about the elements that
 *             make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use them effectively, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the Contents of an Amazon EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
 *                 Guide</i>. For more information about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints,
 *             and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ebs-service.html">Amazon Elastic Block Store Endpoints and Quotas</a> in
 *             the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
