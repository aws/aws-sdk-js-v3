## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript EBS Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create EBS snapshots, write data directly to
your snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between
two snapshots. If youâ€™re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for
Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and cost-effective to track incremental changes on
your EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the differences.</p>

<p>You can create incremental snapshots directly from data on-premises into EBS volumes and the
cloud to use for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots, you can
write your on-premises data to an EBS snapshot during a disaster. Then after recovery, you can
restore it back to AWS or on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and
maintain complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p>

<p>This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about the elements that
make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use them effectively, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the Contents of an EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
Guide</i>. For more information about the supported AWS Regions, endpoints,
and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ebs-service.html">Amazon Elastic Block Store Endpoints and Quotas</a> in
the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-ebs
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-ebs`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-ebs`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-ebs`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `EBSClient` and
the commands you need, for example `CompleteSnapshotCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { EBSClient, CompleteSnapshotCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ebs");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { EBSClient, CompleteSnapshotCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ebs";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new EBSClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new CompleteSnapshotCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-ebs";
const client = new AWS.EBS({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.completeSnapshot(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .completeSnapshot(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.completeSnapshot(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
