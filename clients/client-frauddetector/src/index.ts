/**
 * <p>This is the Amazon Fraud Detector API Reference. This guide is for developers who need
 *             detailed information about Amazon Fraud Detector API actions, data types, and errors. For
 *             more information about Amazon Fraud Detector features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/latest/ug/">Amazon Fraud Detector User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>We provide the Query API as well as AWS software development kits (SDK) for Amazon Fraud Detector in Java and Python programming languages.</p>
 *          <p>The Amazon Fraud Detector Query API provides HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verb GET or POST and a Query parameter <code>Action</code>. AWS SDK provides libraries,
 *             sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead of submitting a request over
 *             HTTP or HTTPS. These libraries provide basic functions that automatically take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and
 *             handling error responses, so that it is easier for you to get started. For more information about the AWS SDKs, go to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to build on AWS</a> page,
 *             scroll down to the <b>SDK</b> section, and choose plus (+) sign to expand the section.
