/**
 * <p>IAM Identity Center is the Amazon Web Services solution for connecting your workforce users to Amazon Web Services managed
 *             applications and other Amazon Web Services resources. You can connect your existing identity provider
 *             and synchronize users and groups from your directory, or create and manage your users
 *             directly in IAM Identity Center. You can then use IAM Identity Center for either or both of the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>User access to applications</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>User access to Amazon Web Services accounts</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>This guide provides information about single sign-on operations that you can use for access to applications and
 *             Amazon Web Services accounts. For information about IAM Identity Center features, see the
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM Identity Center
 *                 User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>IAM Identity Center uses the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API
 *                 namespaces.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>Many API operations for IAM Identity Center rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as
 *             principals. For more information about how to work with principals and principal IDs in
 *             IAM Identity Center, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html">Identity Store API
 *                 Reference</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
 *                 programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The
 *                 SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center and other Amazon Web Services
 *                 services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and
 *                 install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 *                     Services</a>.</p>
