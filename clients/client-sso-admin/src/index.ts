/**
 * <p>IAM Identity Center (successor to Single Sign-On) helps you securely create, or connect, your workforce identities and manage
 *             their access centrally across Amazon Web Services accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the recommended
 *             approach for workforce authentication and authorization in Amazon Web Services, for organizations of
 *             any size and type.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>IAM Identity Center uses the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API
 *                 namespaces.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which could be
 *             used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For information about IAM Identity Center features, see
 *             the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM Identity Center
 *                 User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as
 *             principals. For more information about how to work with principals and principal IDs in
 *             IAM Identity Center, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html">Identity Store API
 *                 Reference</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
 *                 programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The
 *                 SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center and other Amazon Web Services
 *                 services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and
 *                 install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 *                     Services</a>.</p>
