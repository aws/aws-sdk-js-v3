/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified organization conformance pack and all of the Config rules and remediation actions from
 * 			all member accounts in that organization. </p>
 *          <p> Only a management account or a delegated administrator account can delete an organization conformance pack.
 * 	When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure Organizations
 * 		<code>ListDelegatedAdministrator</code> permissions are added.</p>
 *          <p>Config sets the state of a conformance pack to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS until the deletion is complete.
 * 				You cannot update a conformance pack while it is in this state. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ConfigServiceClient, DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-config-service"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ConfigServiceClient, DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-config-service"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ConfigServiceClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteOrganizationConformancePackRequest
 *   OrganizationConformancePackName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommandInput - {@link DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteOrganizationConformancePackCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ConfigServiceClientResolvedConfig | config} for ConfigServiceClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link NoSuchOrganizationConformancePackException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Config organization conformance pack that you passed in the filter does not exist.</p>
 *          <p>For DeleteOrganizationConformancePack, you tried to delete an organization conformance pack that does not exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OrganizationAccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>For <code>PutConfigurationAggregator</code> API, you can see this exception for the following reasons:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>No permission to call <code>EnableAWSServiceAccess</code> API</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The configuration aggregator cannot be updated because your Amazon Web Services Organization management account or the delegated administrator role changed.
 * 				Delete this aggregator and create a new one with the current Amazon Web Services Organization.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The configuration aggregator is associated with a previous Amazon Web Services Organization and Config cannot aggregate data with current Amazon Web Services Organization.
 * 				Delete this aggregator and create a new one with the current Amazon Web Services Organization.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You are not a registered delegated administrator for Config with permissions to call <code>ListDelegatedAdministrators</code> API.
 * 			Ensure that the management account registers delagated administrator for Config service principle name before the delegated administrator creates an aggregator.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>For all <code>OrganizationConfigRule</code> and <code>OrganizationConformancePack</code> APIs, Config throws an exception if APIs are called from member accounts. All APIs must be called from organization management account.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceInUseException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You see this exception in the following cases: </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For DeleteConfigRule, Config is deleting this rule. Try your request again later.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For DeleteConfigRule, the rule is deleting your evaluation results. Try your request again later.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For DeleteConfigRule, a remediation action is associated with the rule and Config cannot delete this rule. Delete the remediation action associated with the rule before deleting the rule and try your request again later.</p>
