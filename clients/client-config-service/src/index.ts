/**
 * <fullname>Config</fullname>
 *          <p>Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations
 * 			of all the Amazon Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account. You can
 * 			use Config to get the current and historical configurations of
 * 			each Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the relationship
 * 			between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute
 * 			Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an
 * 			elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete
 * 			list of resources currently supported by Config, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported Amazon Web Services resources</a>.</p>
 *          <p>You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management
 * 			Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), the Config
 * 			API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference guide contains
 * 			documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI commands that
 * 			you can use to manage Config. The Config API uses the
 * 			Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more
 * 			information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see
 * 				<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
 * 				Version 4 Signing Process</a>. For detailed information
 * 			about Config features and their associated actions or commands,
 * 			as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management Console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html">What Is Config</a> in the <i>Config Developer
 * 				Guide</i>.</p>
