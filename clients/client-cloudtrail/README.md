## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript CloudTrail Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>AWS CloudTrail</fullname>

<p>This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.</p>
<p>CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.</p>

<note>
<p>As an alternative to the API,
you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs
take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
them, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services
page</a>.</p>
</note>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a> for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `CloudTrailClient` and
the commands you need, for example `AddTagsCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { CloudTrailClient, AddTagsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { CloudTrailClient, AddTagsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new CloudTrailClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new AddTagsCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail";
const client = new AWS.CloudTrail({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.addTags(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .addTags(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.addTags(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
