/**
 * <p>Deletes a trail. This operation must be called from the Region in which the trail was
 *          created. <code>DeleteTrail</code> cannot be called on the shadow trails (replicated trails
 *          in other Regions) of a trail that is enabled in all Regions.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudTrailClient, DeleteTrailCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudTrailClient, DeleteTrailCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudtrail"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudTrailClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteTrailRequest
 *   Name: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteTrailCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteTrailCommandInput - {@link DeleteTrailCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteTrailCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteTrailCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteTrailCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudTrailClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudTrailClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link CloudTrailARNInvalidException} (client fault)
 *  <p>This exception is thrown when an operation is called with an ARN that is not valid.</p>
 *          <p>The following is the format of a trail ARN: <code>arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail</code>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>The following is the format of an event data store ARN:
 *          <code>arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:eventdatastore/EXAMPLE-f852-4e8f-8bd1-bcf6cEXAMPLE</code>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>The following is the format of a channel ARN:
 *          <code>arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:channel/01234567890</code>
 *          </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>This exception is thrown when the specified resource is not ready for an operation. This
 *          can occur when you try to run an operation on a resource before CloudTrail has time
 *          to fully load the resource, or because another operation is modifying the resource. If this exception occurs, wait a few minutes, and then try the
 *          operation again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InsufficientDependencyServiceAccessPermissionException} (client fault)
 *  <p>This exception is thrown when the IAM identity that is used to create
 *          the organization resource lacks one or more required permissions for creating an
 *          organization resource in a required service.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidHomeRegionException} (client fault)
 *  <p>This exception is thrown when an operation is called on a trail from a Region other than
 *          the Region in which the trail was created.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidTrailNameException} (client fault)
 *  <p>This exception is thrown when the provided trail name is not valid. Trail names must
 *          meet the following requirements:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores
 *                (_), or dashes (-)</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number</p>
 *             </li>

 *                <p>Be between 3 and 128 characters</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like
 *                   <code>my-_namespace</code> and <code>my--namespace</code> are not valid.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *
 * @throws {@link NoManagementAccountSLRExistsException} (client fault)
 *  <p> This exception is thrown when the management account does not have a service-linked
 *          role. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotOrganizationMasterAccountException} (client fault)
 *  <p>This exception is thrown when the Amazon Web Services account making the request to
 *          create or update an organization trail or event data store is not the management account
 *          for an organization in Organizations. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/creating-an-organizational-trail-prepare.html">Prepare For Creating a Trail For Your Organization</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake-organizations.html">Organization event data stores</a>.</p>
