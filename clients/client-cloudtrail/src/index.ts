 *          <p>This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data
 *          types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.</p>
 *          <p>CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your
 *             Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The
 *          recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response
 *          elements returned by the service.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which
 *             consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms
 *             (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests,
 *             managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the
 *                Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html">CloudTrail
 *          User Guide</a> for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files.</p>
