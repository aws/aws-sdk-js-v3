 * <fullname>Amazon Simple Notification Service</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you
 *             to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push
 *             real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery
 *             protocols. For more information about this product see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">Amazon SNS product page</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features
 *             and their associated API calls, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>. </p>
 *          <p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html">Identity and access management in Amazon SNS</a> in the <i>Amazon SNS Developer
 *                 Guide.</i>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming
 *             language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as:
 *             cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error
 *             responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p>
