## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript TimestreamWrite Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>Amazon Timestream Write</fullname>

<p>Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database service that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of time series data points per day.
With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT sensor data to derive insights from your IoT applications.
You can analyze industrial telemetry to streamline equipment management and maintenance.
You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance and availability of your applications.
Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process,
and store time series data. It organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume of data ingested and on the query volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your data grows over time, Timestreamâ€™s adaptive query processing engine spans across storage tiers to provide fast analysis while reducing costs.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-timestream-write
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-timestream-write`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-timestream-write`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-timestream-write`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `TimestreamWriteClient` and
the commands you need, for example `CreateDatabaseCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { TimestreamWriteClient, CreateDatabaseCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-timestream-write");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { TimestreamWriteClient, CreateDatabaseCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-timestream-write";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new TimestreamWriteClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new CreateDatabaseCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-timestream-write";
const client = new AWS.TimestreamWrite({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.createDatabase(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .createDatabase(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.createDatabase(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
