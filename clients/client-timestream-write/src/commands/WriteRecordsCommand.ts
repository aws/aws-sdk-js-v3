/**
 * <p>Enables you to write your time-series data into Timestream. You can specify a
 *          single data point or a batch of data points to be inserted into the system. Timestream offers you a flexible schema that auto detects the column names and data
 *          types for your Timestream tables based on the dimension names and data types of
 *          the data points you specify when invoking writes into the database. </p>
 *          <p>Timestream supports eventual consistency read semantics. This means that when
 *          you query data immediately after writing a batch of data into Timestream, the
 *          query results might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The
 *          results may also include some stale data. If you repeat the query request after a short
 *          time, the results should return the latest data. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/ts-limits.html">Service quotas apply</a>. </p>
 *          <p>See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/code-samples.write.html">code sample</a> for
 *          details.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Upserts</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>You can use the <code>Version</code> parameter in a <code>WriteRecords</code> request to
 *          update data points. Timestream tracks a version number with each record.
 *             <code>Version</code> defaults to <code>1</code> when it's not specified for the record
 *          in the request. Timestream updates an existing record’s measure value along with
 *          its <code>Version</code> when it receives a write request with a higher
 *             <code>Version</code> number for that record. When it receives an update request where
 *          the measure value is the same as that of the existing record, Timestream still
 *          updates <code>Version</code>, if it is greater than the existing value of
 *             <code>Version</code>. You can update a data point as many times as desired, as long as
 *          the value of <code>Version</code> continuously increases. </p>
 *          <p> For example, suppose you write a new record without indicating <code>Version</code> in
 *          the request. Timestream stores this record, and set <code>Version</code> to
 *             <code>1</code>. Now, suppose you try to update this record with a
 *             <code>WriteRecords</code> request of the same record with a different measure value but,
 *          like before, do not provide <code>Version</code>. In this case, Timestream will
 *          reject this update with a <code>RejectedRecordsException</code> since the updated record’s
 *          version is not greater than the existing value of Version. </p>
 *          <p>However, if you were to resend the update request with <code>Version</code> set to
 *             <code>2</code>, Timestream would then succeed in updating the record’s value,
 *          and the <code>Version</code> would be set to <code>2</code>. Next, suppose you sent a
 *             <code>WriteRecords</code> request with this same record and an identical measure value,
 *          but with <code>Version</code> set to <code>3</code>. In this case, Timestream
 *          would only update <code>Version</code> to <code>3</code>. Any further updates would need to
 *          send a version number greater than <code>3</code>, or the update requests would receive a
 *             <code>RejectedRecordsException</code>. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
