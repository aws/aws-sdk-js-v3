/**
 * <p>Deletes a member. Deleting a member removes the member and all associated resources from the network. <code>DeleteMember</code> can only be called for a specified <code>MemberId</code> if the principal performing the action is associated with the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member. In all other cases, the <code>DeleteMember</code> action is carried out as the result of an approved proposal to remove a member. If <code>MemberId</code> is the last member in a network specified by the last Amazon Web Services account, the network is deleted also.</p>
 *          <p>Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ManagedBlockchainClient, DeleteMemberCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-managedblockchain"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ManagedBlockchainClient, DeleteMemberCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-managedblockchain"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ManagedBlockchainClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteMemberInput
 *   NetworkId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   MemberId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteMemberCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteMemberCommandInput - {@link DeleteMemberCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteMemberCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteMemberCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteMemberCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ManagedBlockchainClientResolvedConfig | config} for ManagedBlockchainClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You don't have sufficient access to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServiceErrorException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception or failure.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The action or operation requested is invalid. Verify that the action is typed correctly.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A requested resource doesn't exist. It may have been deleted or referenced incorrectly.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotReadyException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested resource exists but isn't in a status that can complete the operation.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request or operation couldn't be performed because a service is
 *          throttling requests. The most common source of throttling errors is
 *          creating resources that exceed your service limit for this resource type.
 *          Request a limit increase or delete unused resources if possible.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ManagedBlockchainServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from ManagedBlockchain service.</p>
