## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript AlexaForBusiness Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Alexa for Business helps you use Alexa in your organization. Alexa for Business provides you with the tools
to manage Alexa devices, enroll your users, and assign skills, at scale. You can build your
own context-aware voice skills using the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa for Business API operations.
You can also make these available as private skills for your organization. Alexa for Business makes it
efficient to voice-enable your products and services, thus providing context-aware voice
experiences for your customers. Device makers building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS)
can create fully integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa for Business, and manage them
as shared devices in their organization. </p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `AlexaForBusinessClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ApproveSkillCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { AlexaForBusinessClient, ApproveSkillCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { AlexaForBusinessClient, ApproveSkillCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new AlexaForBusinessClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ApproveSkillCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business";
const client = new AWS.AlexaForBusiness({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.approveSkill(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .approveSkill(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.approveSkill(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
