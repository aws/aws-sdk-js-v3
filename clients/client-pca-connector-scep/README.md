# @aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep

## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript PcaConnectorScep Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Connector for SCEP creates a connector between Amazon Web Services Private CA and your SCEP-enabled clients and devices. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/scep-connector.htmlconnector-for-scep.html">Connector for SCEP</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Private CA User Guide</i>.</p>

## Installing

To install this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `PcaConnectorScepClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ListConnectorsCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { PcaConnectorScepClient, ListConnectorsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { PcaConnectorScepClient, ListConnectorsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new PcaConnectorScepClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ListConnectorsCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-pca-connector-scep";
const client = new AWS.PcaConnectorScep({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.listConnectors(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .listConnectors(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.listConnectors(params, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
