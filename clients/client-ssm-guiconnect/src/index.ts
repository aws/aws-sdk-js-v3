 *          <p>Systems Manager GUI Connect, a component of Fleet Manager, lets you connect to your Window
 *          Server-type Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). GUI
 *          Connect, which is powered by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/what-is-dcv.html">Amazon DCV</a>, provides you
 *          with secure connectivity to your Windows Server instances directly from the Systems Manager console.
 *          You can have up to four simultaneous connections in a single browser window. In the
 *          console, GUI Connect is also referred to as Fleet Manager Remote Desktop.</p>
