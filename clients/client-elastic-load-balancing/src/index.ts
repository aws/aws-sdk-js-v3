 * <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
 *
 *         <p>A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances.
 *             This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer
 *             also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes traffic
 *             only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic
 *             by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port
 *             number for connections from clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number
 *             for connections from the load balancer to the instances.</p>
 *         <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers,
 *             and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more
 *             information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User Guide</a>.</p>
 *         <p>This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load Balancers.
 *             The 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers.</p>
 *
 *         <p>To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>.
 *             Register your instances with the load balancer using <a>RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer</a>.</p>
 *
 *         <p>All Elastic Load Balancing operations are <i>idempotent</i>, which means
 *             that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK
 *             response code.</p>
