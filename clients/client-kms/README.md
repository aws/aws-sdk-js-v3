## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript KMS Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>Key Management Service</fullname>

<p>Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes
the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS,
see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/">
<i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>
</a>.</p>
<note>
<p>KMS is replacing the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a
convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example,
the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to
download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
Services</a>.</p>
</note>
<p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p>
<p>Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients
must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems
such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p>
<p>
<b>Signing Requests</b>
</p>
<p>Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly
recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your Amazon Web Services account (root) access key ID and
secret key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key
for an IAM user. You can also use the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to generate temporary
security credentials that you can use to sign requests.</p>
<p>All KMS operations require <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Logging API Requests</b>
</p>
<p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your
Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the
information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made
the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it
on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-kms
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-kms`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-kms`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-kms`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `KMSClient` and
the commands you need, for example `CancelKeyDeletionCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { KMSClient, CancelKeyDeletionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-kms");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { KMSClient, CancelKeyDeletionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-kms";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new KMSClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new CancelKeyDeletionCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-kms";
const client = new AWS.KMS({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.cancelKeyDeletion(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .cancelKeyDeletion(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.cancelKeyDeletion(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
