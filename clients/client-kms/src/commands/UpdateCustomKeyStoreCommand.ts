/**
 * <p>Changes the properties of a custom key store. You can use this operation to change the
 *       properties of an CloudHSM key store or an external key store.</p>
 *          <p>Use the required <code>CustomKeyStoreId</code> parameter to identify the custom key store.
 *       Use the remaining optional parameters to change its properties. This operation does not return
 *       any property values. To verify the updated property values, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p>
 *          <p> This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key stores</a> feature in KMS, which
 * combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a
 * key store that you own and manage.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the updated settings
 *         connect your key store, via the external key store proxy, to the same external key manager
 *         as the previous settings, or to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with the
 *         same cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can fix them and
 *         retry, although an extended delay might disrupt Amazon Web Services services. However, if KMS
 *         permanently loses its access to cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys is
 *         unrecoverable.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>For external key stores:</p>
 *             <p>Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an external key store.
 *         For details, see your external key manager documentation.</p>
 *             <p>When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload a JSON-based
 *         proxy configuration file with the desired values. You cannot upload the proxy configuration
 *         file to the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> operation. However, you can use the file to
 *         help you determine the correct values for the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code>
 *         parameters.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly
 *       name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), to tell KMS about a change to the
 *         <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user password (<code>KeyStorePassword</code>), or to associate
 *       the custom key store with a different, but related, CloudHSM cluster
 *         (<code>CloudHsmClusterId</code>). To update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the
 *         <code>ConnectionState</code> of the CloudHSM key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. </p>
 *          <p>For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store
 *       friendly name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), or to tell KMS about a change to the
 *       external key store proxy authentication credentials
 *         (<code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>), connection method
 *         (<code>XksProxyConnectivity</code>), external proxy endpoint
 *         (<code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code>) and path (<code>XksProxyUriPath</code>). For external key
 *       stores with an <code>XksProxyConnectivity</code> of <code>VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE</code>, you can
 *       also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name (<code>XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName</code>). To
 *       update most properties of an external key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the
 *       external key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. However, you can update the
 *         <code>CustomKeyStoreName</code>, <code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>, and
 *         <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or
 *       DISCONNECTED state. </p>
 *          <p>If your update requires a <code>DISCONNECTED</code> state, before using
 *         <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code>, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a>
 *       operation to disconnect the custom key store. After the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code>
 *       operation completes, use the <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> to reconnect the custom
 *       key store. To find the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation. </p>
 *          <p>
 *     </p>
 *          <p>Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow KMS to connect
 *       the custom key store to its backing key store. For example, before you change the
 *         <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> value, verify that the external key store proxy is reachable at
 *       the new path.</p>
 *          <p>If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no
 * properties.</p>
