/**
 * <p>Creates a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key store</a> backed by a key store that you own and manage. When you use a
 *       KMS key in a custom key store for a cryptographic operation, the cryptographic operation is
 *       actually performed in your key store using your keys. KMS supports <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-cloudhsm.html">CloudHSM key stores</a>
 *       backed by an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/clusters.html">CloudHSM cluster</a>
 *       and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html">external key
 *         stores</a> backed by an external key store proxy and external key manager outside of
 *       Amazon Web Services.</p>
 *          <p> This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key stores</a> feature in KMS, which
 * combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a
 * key store that you own and manage.</p>
 *          <p>Before you create the custom key store, the required elements must be in place and
 *       operational. We recommend that you use the test tools that KMS provides to verify the
 *       configuration your external key store proxy. For details about the required elements and
 *       verification tests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keystore.html#before-keystore">Assemble the prerequisites (for
 *         CloudHSM key stores)</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-xks-keystore.html#xks-requirements">Assemble the prerequisites (for
 *         external key stores)</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>To create a custom key store, use the following parameters.</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>To create an CloudHSM key store, specify the <code>CustomKeyStoreName</code>,
 *             <code>CloudHsmClusterId</code>, <code>KeyStorePassword</code>, and
 *             <code>TrustAnchorCertificate</code>. The <code>CustomKeyStoreType</code> parameter is
 *           optional for CloudHSM key stores. If you include it, set it to the default value,
 *             <code>AWS_CLOUDHSM</code>. For help with failures, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html">Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key store</a> in the
 *           <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>To create an external key store, specify the <code>CustomKeyStoreName</code> and a
 *             <code>CustomKeyStoreType</code> of <code>EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE</code>. Also, specify values
 *           for <code>XksProxyConnectivity</code>, <code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>,
 *             <code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code>, and <code>XksProxyUriPath</code>. If your
 *             <code>XksProxyConnectivity</code> value is <code>VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE</code>, specify
 *           the <code>XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName</code> parameter. For help with failures, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/xks-troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting
 *             an external key store</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>For external key stores:</p>
 *             <p>Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating an external key store.
 *         For details, see your external key manager documentation.</p>
 *             <p>When creating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload a JSON-based
 *         proxy configuration file with the desired values. You cannot use a proxy configuration with
 *         the <code>CreateCustomKeyStore</code> operation. However, you can use the values in the file
 *         to help you determine the correct values for the <code>CreateCustomKeyStore</code>
 *         parameters.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store.
 *       Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to connect a new CloudHSM key store to its CloudHSM
 *       cluster, or to connect a new external key store to the external key store proxy for your
 *       external key manager. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you
 *       might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until
 *       you are ready to use it.</p>
 *          <p>For help with failures, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html">Troubleshooting a custom key store</a> in the
