/**
 * <p>Deletes a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key store</a>. This operation does not affect any backing elements of the
 *       custom key store. It does not delete the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with an CloudHSM key
 *       store, or affect any users or keys in the cluster. For an external key store, it does not
 *       affect the external key store proxy, external key manager, or any external keys.</p>
 *          <p> This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key stores</a> feature in KMS, which
 * combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a
 * key store that you own and manage.</p>
 *          <p>The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys">KMS keys</a>. Before deleting the key store,
 *       verify that you will never need to use any of the KMS keys in the key store for any
 *       <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations">cryptographic operations</a>. Then, use <a>ScheduleKeyDeletion</a> to delete the KMS keys from the
 *       key store. After the required waiting period expires and all KMS keys are deleted from the
 *       custom key store, use <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> to disconnect the key store
 *       from KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store.</p>
 *          <p>For keys in an CloudHSM key store, the <code>ScheduleKeyDeletion</code> operation makes a
 *       best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to
 *       manually <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key">delete the orphaned key
 *         material</a> from the cluster and its backups. KMS never creates, manages, or deletes
 *       cryptographic keys in the external key manager associated with an external key store. You must
 *       manage them using your external key manager tools.</p>
 *          <p>Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store from its
 *       backing key store. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the KMS keys
 *       in the key store. But, you do not need to delete KMS keys and you can reconnect a disconnected
 *       custom key store at any time.</p>
 *          <p>If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no
 * properties.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.</p>
