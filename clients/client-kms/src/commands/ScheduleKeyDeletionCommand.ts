/**
 * <p>Schedules the deletion of a KMS key. By default, KMS applies a waiting period of 30
 *       days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days. When this operation is successful,
 *       the key state of the KMS key changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code> and the key can't be used
 *       in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting
 *       period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use <a>CancelKeyDeletion</a> to
 *       cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key,
 *       its key material, and all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to
 *       it.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS key
 *         is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only
 *         exception is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html">multi-Region replica key</a>, or an <a href="kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-managing.html#import-delete-key">asymmetric or HMAC KMS
 *           key with imported key material</a>.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting
 *         it, use <a>DisableKey</a>. </p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any
 *       time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If
 *       you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to
 *         <code>PendingReplicaDeletion</code> and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic
 *       operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is
 *       deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to
 *         <code>PendingDeletion</code> and its waiting period (<code>PendingWindowInDays</code>)
 *       begins. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html">Deleting multi-Region keys</a> in the
 *       <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>When KMS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/delete-cmk-keystore.html">deletes
 *         a KMS key from an CloudHSM key store</a>, it makes a best effort to delete the associated
 *       key material from the associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key">delete
 *         the orphaned key material</a> from the cluster and its backups. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/delete-xks-key.html">Deleting a KMS key from an
 *         external key store</a> has no effect on the associated external key. However, for both
 *       types of custom key stores, deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible. You cannot
 *       decrypt ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only its associated external key or
 *       CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a KMS key in an external key store by creating a new KMS
 *       key with the same key material.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about scheduling a KMS key for deletion, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html">Deleting KMS keys</a> in the
 *       <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
