/**
 * <p>Connects or reconnects a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key store</a> to its backing key store. For an CloudHSM key
 *       store, <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> connects the key store to its associated CloudHSM
 *       cluster. For an external key store, <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> connects the key store
 *       to the external key store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.</p>
 *          <p>The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key store or
 *       use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any
 *       time.</p>
 *          <p>The connection process for a custom key store can take an extended amount of time to
 *       complete. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to
 *       complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON
 *       object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store
 *       is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p>
 *          <p> This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key stores</a> feature in KMS, which
 * combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a
 * key store that you own and manage.</p>
 *          <p>The <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> operation might fail for various reasons. To find
 *       the reason, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation and see the
 *         <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code> in the response. For help interpreting the
 *         <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code>, see <a>CustomKeyStoresListEntry</a>.</p>
 *          <p>To fix the failure, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to
 *       disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> operation if necessary, and then use
 *         <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> again.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>CloudHSM key store</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>During the connection process for an CloudHSM key store, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster that
 *       is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to
 *       the cluster, logs into the CloudHSM client as the <code>kmsuser</code> CU, and rotates its
 *       password.</p>
 *          <p>To connect an CloudHSM key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active
 *       HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html">DescribeClusters</a> operation. To add HSMs
 *       to the cluster, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html">CreateHsm</a> operation. Also, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser">
 *                <code>kmsuser</code> crypto
 *         user</a> (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents KMS from using this
 *       account to log in.</p>
 *          <p>If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a CloudHSM key store, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html">Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key
 *         store</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>External key store</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>When you connect an external key store that uses public endpoint connectivity, KMS tests
 *       its ability to communicate with your external key manager by sending a request via the
 *       external key store proxy.</p>
 *          <p>When you connect to an external key store that uses VPC endpoint service connectivity,
 *       KMS establishes the networking elements that it needs to communicate with your external key
 *       manager via the external key store proxy. This includes creating an interface endpoint to the
 *       VPC endpoint service and a private hosted zone for traffic between KMS and the VPC endpoint
 *       service.</p>
 *          <p>To connect an external key store, KMS must be able to connect to the external key store
 *       proxy, the external key store proxy must be able to communicate with your external key
 *       manager, and the external key manager must be available for cryptographic operations.</p>
 *          <p>If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting an external key store, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/xks-troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting an external
 *         key store</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
