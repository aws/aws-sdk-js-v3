/**
 * <fullname>AWS Key Management Service</fullname>
 *          <p>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes
 *       the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS,
 *       see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/">
 *                <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>
 *             </a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
 *         languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a
 *         convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example,
 *         the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
 *         retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to
 *         download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 *           Services</a>.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.</p>
 *          <p>Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients
 *       must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
 *       Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems
 *       such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Signing Requests</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly
 *       recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your AWS account (root) access key ID and
 *       secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key
 *       for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary
 *       security credentials that you can use to sign requests.</p>
 *          <p>All AWS KMS operations require <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Logging API Requests</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS
 *       account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information
 *       collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request,
 *       when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find
 *       your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>
