 * <p>Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) Query provides you with convenient access to multi-blockchain network data, which makes
 *         it easier for you to extract contextual data related to blockchain activity. You can use AMB Query to
 *         read data from public blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin Mainnet and Ethereum Mainnet. You can
 *         also get information such as the current and historical balances of addresses, or you can get a
 *         list of blockchain transactions for a given time period. Additionally, you can get details of a
 *         given transaction, such as transaction events, which you can further analyze or use in business
 *         logic for your applications.</p>
