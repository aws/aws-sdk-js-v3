 * <fullname>Amazon DynamoDB</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast
 *             and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you
 *             offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so
 *             that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration,
 *             replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.</p>
 *          <p>With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve
 *             any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale
 *             down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and
 *             use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance
 *             metrics.</p>
 *          <p>DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over
 *             a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while
 *             maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state
 *             disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an
 *                 Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data
 *             durability.</p>
