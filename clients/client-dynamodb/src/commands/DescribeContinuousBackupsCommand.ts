/**
 * <p>Checks the status of continuous backups and point in time recovery on the specified
 *             table. Continuous backups are <code>ENABLED</code> on all tables at table creation. If
 *             point in time recovery is enabled, <code>PointInTimeRecoveryStatus</code> will be set to
 *             ENABLED.</p>
 *         <p> After continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can restore to
 *             any point in time within <code>EarliestRestorableDateTime</code> and
 *                 <code>LatestRestorableDateTime</code>. </p>
 *         <p>
 *             <code>LatestRestorableDateTime</code> is typically 5 minutes before the current time.
 *             You can restore your table to any point in time during the last 35 days. </p>
 *         <p>You can call <code>DescribeContinuousBackups</code> at a maximum rate of 10 times per
 *             second.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { DynamoDBClient, DescribeContinuousBackupsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { DynamoDBClient, DescribeContinuousBackupsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new DynamoDBClient(config);
 * const command = new DescribeContinuousBackupsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DescribeContinuousBackupsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DescribeContinuousBackupsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link DynamoDBClientResolvedConfig | config} for DynamoDBClient's `config` shape.
