 * <p>With the Amazon Location Routes API you can calculate routes and estimate travel time
 *          based on up-to-date road network and live traffic information.</p>
 *          <p>Calculate optimal travel routes and estimate travel times using up-to-date road network
 *          and traffic data. Key features include:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Point-to-point routing with estimated travel time, distance, and turn-by-turn
 *                directions</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Multi-point route optimization to minimize travel time or distance</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Route matrices for efficient multi-destination planning</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Isoline calculations to determine reachable areas within specified time or
 *                distance thresholds</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Map-matching to align GPS traces with the road network</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
