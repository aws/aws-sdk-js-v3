/**
 * <p>Deletes a hosted zone.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>If the hosted zone was created by another service, such as AWS Cloud Map, see
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DeleteHostedZone.html#delete-public-hosted-zone-created-by-another-service">Deleting
 * 			Public Hosted Zones That Were Created by Another Service</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i> for information about how to delete it.
 * 			(The process is the same for public and private hosted zones that were created by another service.)</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>If you want to keep your domain registration but you want to stop routing internet traffic to your website or web application,
 * 			we recommend that you delete resource record sets in the hosted zone instead of deleting the hosted zone.</p>
 *
 * 		       <important>
 * 			         <p>If you delete a hosted zone, you can't undelete it. You must create a new hosted zone and update the name servers for your
 * 				domain registration, which can require up to 48 hours to take effect. (If you delegated responsibility for a subdomain to a hosted zone
 * 				and you delete the child hosted zone, you must update the name servers in the parent hosted zone.) In addition, if you delete a hosted zone,
 * 				someone could hijack the domain and route traffic to their own resources using your domain name.</p>
 * 		       </important>
 *
 * 		       <p>If you want to avoid the monthly charge for the hosted zone, you can transfer DNS service for the domain to a free DNS service.
 * 			When you transfer DNS service, you have to update the name servers for the domain registration. If the domain is registered with Route 53,
 * 			see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_UpdateDomainNameservers.html">UpdateDomainNameservers</a>
 * 			for information about how to replace Route 53 name servers with name servers for the new DNS service. If the domain is registered with
 * 			another registrar, use the method provided by the registrar to update name servers for the domain registration. For more information,
 * 			perform an internet search on "free DNS service."</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>You can delete a hosted zone only if it contains only the default SOA record and NS resource record sets.
 * 			If the hosted zone contains other resource record sets, you must delete them before you can delete the hosted zone.
 * 			If you try to delete a hosted zone that contains other resource record sets, the request fails, and Route 53 returns a
 * 			<code>HostedZoneNotEmpty</code> error. For information about deleting records from your hosted zone, see
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeResourceRecordSets.html">ChangeResourceRecordSets</a>.</p>
 * 		       <p>To verify that the hosted zone has been deleted, do one of the following:</p>
 * 		       <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the <code>GetHostedZone</code> action to request information about the hosted zone.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the <code>ListHostedZones</code> action to get a list of the hosted zones associated with the current
 * 				AWS account.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
