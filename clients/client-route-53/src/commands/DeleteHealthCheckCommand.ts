/**
 * <p>Deletes a health check.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Amazon Route 53 does not prevent you from deleting a health check even if the
 * 				health check is associated with one or more resource record sets. If you delete a
 * 				health check and you don't update the associated resource record sets, the future
 * 				status of the health check can't be predicted and may change. This will affect the
 * 				routing of DNS queries for your DNS failover configuration. For more information,
 * 				see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-creating-deleting.html#health-checks-deleting.html">Replacing and Deleting Health Checks</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53
 * 					Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>If you're using Cloud Map and you configured Cloud Map to create a Route 53
 * 			health check when you register an instance, you can't use the Route 53
 * 				<code>DeleteHealthCheck</code> command to delete the health check. The health check
 * 			is deleted automatically when you deregister the instance; there can be a delay of
 * 			several hours before the health check is deleted from Route 53. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { Route53Client, DeleteHealthCheckCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-route-53"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { Route53Client, DeleteHealthCheckCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-route-53"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new Route53Client(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteHealthCheckRequest
 *   HealthCheckId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteHealthCheckCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteHealthCheckCommandInput - {@link DeleteHealthCheckCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteHealthCheckCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteHealthCheckCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteHealthCheckCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link Route53ClientResolvedConfig | config} for Route53Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link HealthCheckInUse} (client fault)
 *  <p>This error code is not in use.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidInput} (client fault)
 *  <p>The input is not valid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NoSuchHealthCheck} (client fault)
 *  <p>No health check exists with the specified ID.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link Route53ServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from Route53 service.</p>
