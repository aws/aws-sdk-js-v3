/**
 * <p>Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone. </p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already
 * 				exist. You can't convert a public hosted zone into a private hosted zone.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>If you want to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon Web Services account with a private hosted zone that was created by using a
 * 				different account, the Amazon Web Services account that created the private hosted
 * 				zone must first submit a <code>CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> request.
 * 				Then the account that created the VPC must submit an
 * 					<code>AssociateVPCWithHostedZone</code> request.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>When granting access, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to
 * 				the same partition. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each
 * 					Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition.</p>
 *             <p>The following are the supported partitions:</p>
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <code>aws</code> - Amazon Web Services Regions</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <code>aws-cn</code> - China Regions</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <code>aws-us-gov</code> - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ul>
 *             <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Access Management</a>
