/**
 * <p>Creates a new public or private hosted zone. You create records in a public hosted
 * 			zone to define how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as
 * 			example.com, and its subdomains (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records
 * 			in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its
 * 			subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs). </p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa.
 * 				Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new
 * 				resource record sets.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>For more information about charges for hosted zones, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/">Amazon Route 53 Pricing</a>.</p>
 *          <p>Note the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as
 * 					.com.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record
 * 					and four NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS records,
 * 					see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html">NS and SOA Records
 * 						that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone</a> in the
 * 						<i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *                <p>If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you
 * 					can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone. See the
 * 						<code>DelegationSetId</code> element.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53,
 * 					you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS
 * 					service for the domain. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html">Migrating DNS Service
 * 						for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53</a> in the
 * 						<i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>. </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>When you submit a <code>CreateHostedZone</code> request, the initial status of the
 * 			hosted zone is <code>PENDING</code>. For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and
 * 			SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and
 * 			SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to <code>INSYNC</code>.</p>
 *          <p>The <code>CreateHostedZone</code> request requires the caller to have an
 * 				<code>ec2:DescribeVpcs</code> permission.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>When creating private hosted zones, the Amazon VPC must belong to the same
 * 				partition where the hosted zone is created. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one
 * 				partition.</p>
 *             <p>The following are the supported partitions:</p>
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <code>aws</code> - Amazon Web Services Regions</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <code>aws-cn</code> - China Regions</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <code>aws-us-gov</code> - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ul>
 *             <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Access Management</a>
 * 				in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
