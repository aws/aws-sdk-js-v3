/**
 * <p>Authorizes the Amazon Web Services account that created a specified VPC to submit an
 * 				<code>AssociateVPCWithHostedZone</code> request to associate the VPC with a
 * 			specified hosted zone that was created by a different account. To submit a
 * 				<code>CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> request, you must use the account
 * 			that created the hosted zone. After you authorize the association, use the account that
 * 			created the VPC to submit an <code>AssociateVPCWithHostedZone</code> request.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>If you want to associate multiple VPCs that you created by using one account with
 * 				a hosted zone that you created by using a different account, you must submit one
 * 				authorization request for each VPC.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
