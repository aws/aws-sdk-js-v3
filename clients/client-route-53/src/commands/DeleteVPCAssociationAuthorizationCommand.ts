/**
 * <p>Removes authorization to submit an <code>AssociateVPCWithHostedZone</code> request to
 * 			associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different account.
 * 			You must use the account that created the hosted zone to submit a
 * 				<code>DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> request.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Sending this request only prevents the Amazon Web Services account that created the
 * 				VPC from associating the VPC with the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone in the future. If
 * 				the VPC is already associated with the hosted zone,
 * 					<code>DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> won't disassociate the VPC from
 * 				the hosted zone. If you want to delete an existing association, use
 * 					<code>DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone</code>.</p>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { Route53Client, DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-route-53"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { Route53Client, DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-route-53"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new Route53Client(config);
 * const command = new DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link Route53ClientResolvedConfig | config} for Route53Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ConcurrentModification} (client fault)
 *  <p>Another user submitted a request to create, update, or delete the object at the same
 * 			time that you did. Retry the request. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidInput} (client fault)
 *  <p>The input is not valid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidVPCId} (client fault)
 *  <p>The VPC ID that you specified either isn't a valid ID or the current account is not
 * 			authorized to access this VPC.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NoSuchHostedZone} (client fault)
 *  <p>No hosted zone exists with the ID that you specified.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link VPCAssociationAuthorizationNotFound} (client fault)
 *  <p>The VPC that you specified is not authorized to be associated with the hosted
 * 			zone.</p>
