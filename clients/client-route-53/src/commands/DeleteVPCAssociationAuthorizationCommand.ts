/**
 * @public
 * <p>Removes authorization to submit an <code>AssociateVPCWithHostedZone</code> request to
 * 			associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different account.
 * 			You must use the account that created the hosted zone to submit a
 * 				<code>DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> request.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Sending this request only prevents the Amazon Web Services account that created the
 * 				VPC from associating the VPC with the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone in the future. If
 * 				the VPC is already associated with the hosted zone,
 * 					<code>DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> won't disassociate the VPC from
 * 				the hosted zone. If you want to delete an existing association, use
 * 					<code>DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone</code>.</p>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { Route53Client, DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-route-53"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { Route53Client, DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-route-53"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new Route53Client(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationRequest
 *   HostedZoneId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   VPC: { // VPC
 *     VPCRegion: "us-east-1" || "us-east-2" || "us-west-1" || "us-west-2" || "eu-west-1" || "eu-west-2" || "eu-west-3" || "eu-central-1" || "eu-central-2" || "ap-east-1" || "me-south-1" || "us-gov-west-1" || "us-gov-east-1" || "us-iso-east-1" || "us-iso-west-1" || "us-isob-east-1" || "me-central-1" || "ap-southeast-1" || "ap-southeast-2" || "ap-southeast-3" || "ap-south-1" || "ap-south-2" || "ap-northeast-1" || "ap-northeast-2" || "ap-northeast-3" || "eu-north-1" || "sa-east-1" || "ca-central-1" || "cn-north-1" || "af-south-1" || "eu-south-1" || "eu-south-2" || "ap-southeast-4",
