/**
 * <p>Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console designed to help users
 *          mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their Amazon Web Services-hosted applications.
 *          An incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of services.</p>
 *          <p>Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying responders of
 *          impact, highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration tools to
 *          get services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of reducing the
 *          time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager automates response plans
 *          and enables responder team escalation.</p>
