/**
 * <p>Deletes a secret and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery window during
 *             which you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days. The default
 *             recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a <code>DeletionDate</code> stamp to the
 *             secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window,
 *             Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.</p>
 *          <p>You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other Regions. You must first
 *             delete the replicas using <a>RemoveRegionsFromReplication</a>, and then
 *             delete the primary secret. When you delete a replica, it is deleted immediately.</p>
 *          <p>You can't directly delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove all staging
 *             labels from the version using <a>UpdateSecretVersionStage</a>. This marks the
 *             version as deprecated, and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the version in the
 *             background.</p>
 *          <p>To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm
 *             to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during the recovery window. For more
 *             information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets.html">
 *                 Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion</a>.</p>
 *          <p>Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a
 *             background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the
 *             recovery window for the permanent delete to occur.</p>
 *          <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use <a>RestoreSecret</a>
 *             to remove the <code>DeletionDate</code> and cancel the deletion of the secret.</p>
 *          <p>When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value. You
 *             must first cancel the deletion with <a>RestoreSecret</a> and then you can
 *             retrieve the secret.</p>
 *          <p>Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html">Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail</a>.</p>

 * const input = { // DeleteSecretRequest
 *   SecretId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   RecoveryWindowInDays: Number("long"),
 *   ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteSecretCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeleteSecretResponse

 *             <li>
 *                <p>You tried to enable rotation on a secret that doesn't already have a Lambda function
 *           ARN configured and you didn't include such an ARN as a parameter in this call. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The secret is managed by another service, and you must use that service to update it.
