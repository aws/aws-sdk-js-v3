/**
 * @public
 * <p>Deletes a secret and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery
 *       window during which you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days.
 *       The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a <code>DeletionDate</code> stamp to
 *       the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window,
 *       Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.</p>
 *          <p>You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other Regions. You must first delete the
 *     replicas using <a>RemoveRegionsFromReplication</a>, and then delete the primary secret.
 *     When you delete a replica, it is deleted immediately.</p>
 *          <p>You can't directly delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove all staging labels
 *     from the version using <a>UpdateSecretVersionStage</a>. This marks the version as deprecated,
 *     and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the version in the background.</p>
 *          <p>To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm
 *     to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during the recovery window. For more information,
 *     see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring_cloudwatch_deleted-secrets.html">
 *     Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion</a>.</p>
 *          <p>Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a
 *         background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the
 *         recovery window for the permanent delete to occur.</p>
 *          <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use <a>RestoreSecret</a> to
 *       remove the <code>DeletionDate</code> and cancel the deletion of the secret.</p>
 *          <p>When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value.
 *       You must first cancel the deletion with <a>RestoreSecret</a> and then you can retrieve the secret.</p>
 *          <p>Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html">Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail</a>.</p>

 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The secret is managed by another service, and you must use that service to update it.
