 * <p>Deletes a continuous deployment policy.</p>
 *          <p>You cannot delete a continuous deployment policy that's attached to a primary
 * 			distribution. First update your distribution to remove the continuous deployment policy,
 * 			then you can delete the policy.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudFrontClient, DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudFrontClient, DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudFrontClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyRequest
 *   Id: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   IfMatch: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandInput - {@link DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudFrontClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudFrontClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDenied} (client fault)
 *  <p>Access denied.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ContinuousDeploymentPolicyInUse} (client fault)
 *  <p>You cannot delete a continuous deployment policy that is associated with a primary
 * 			distribution.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidArgument} (client fault)
 *  <p>An argument is invalid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidIfMatchVersion} (client fault)
 *  <p>The <code>If-Match</code> version is missing or not valid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NoSuchContinuousDeploymentPolicy} (client fault)
 *  <p>The continuous deployment policy doesn't exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PreconditionFailed} (client fault)
 *  <p>The precondition in one or more of the request fields evaluated to
 * 			<code>false</code>.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link CloudFrontServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from CloudFront service.</p>
