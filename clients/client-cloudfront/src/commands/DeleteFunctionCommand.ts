/**
 * Deletes a CloudFront function.
 *
 * You cannot delete a function if it's associated with a cache behavior. First, update your distributions to remove the function association from all cache behaviors, then delete the function.
 *
 * To delete a function, you must provide the function's name and version (`ETag` value). To get these values, you can use `ListFunctions` and `DescribeFunction`.
 *
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudFrontClient, DeleteFunctionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudFrontClient, DeleteFunctionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { CloudFrontClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront";
 * const config = {}; // type is CloudFrontClientConfig
 * const client = new CloudFrontClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteFunctionRequest
 *   Name: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   IfMatch: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteFunctionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteFunctionCommandInput - {@link DeleteFunctionCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteFunctionCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteFunctionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteFunctionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudFrontClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudFrontClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link FunctionInUse} (client fault)
 *
 * Cannot delete the function because it's attached to one or more cache behaviors.
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidIfMatchVersion} (client fault)
 *
 * The `If-Match` version is missing or not valid.
 *
 * @throws {@link NoSuchFunctionExists} (client fault)
 *
 * The function does not exist.
 *
 * @throws {@link PreconditionFailed} (client fault)
 *
 * The precondition in one or more of the request fields evaluated to `false`.
 *
 * @throws {@link UnsupportedOperation} (client fault)
 *
 * This operation is not supported in this Amazon Web Services Region.
 *
 * @throws {@link CloudFrontServiceException}
 *
 * Base exception class for all service exceptions from CloudFront service.
