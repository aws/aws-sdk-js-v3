/**
 * <p>Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL
 *             to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your
 *             data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay
 *             only for the queries you run. Athena scales automatically—executing queries
 *             in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more
 *             information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">What is Amazon Athena</a> in the <i>Amazon Athena User
 *                 Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the
 *             driver or later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers do not
 *             support the API. For more information and to download the driver, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html">Accessing
 *                     Amazon Athena with JDBC</a>.</p>
