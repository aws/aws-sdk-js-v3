 * <p>DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX
 *             dramatically speeds up database reads by caching frequently-accessed data from DynamoDB, so
 *             applications can access that data with sub-millisecond latency. You can create a DAX
 *             cluster easily, using the AWS Management Console. With a few simple modifications to
 *             your code, your application can begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster and realize
 *             significant improvements in read performance.</p>
