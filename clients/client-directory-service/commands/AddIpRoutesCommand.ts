 * <p>If the DNS server for your on-premises domain uses a publicly addressable IP address, you must add a CIDR address block to correctly route traffic to and from your Microsoft AD on Amazon Web Services. <i>AddIpRoutes</i> adds this address block. You can also use <i>AddIpRoutes</i> to facilitate routing traffic that uses public IP ranges from your Microsoft AD on AWS to a peer VPC. </p>
