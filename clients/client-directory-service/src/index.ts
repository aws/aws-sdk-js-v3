 * <fullname>Directory Service</fullname>
 *          <p>Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the
 *          Amazon Web Services cloud, or connect your Amazon Web Services resources with an existing self-managed Microsoft Active
 *          Directory. This guide provides detailed information about Directory Service operations, data types,
 *          parameters, and errors. For information about Directory Services features, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">Directory Service</a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html">Directory Service
 *             Administration Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
 *             programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
 *             provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Directory Service and other Amazon Web Services
 *             services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and
 *             install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 *                Services</a>.</p>
