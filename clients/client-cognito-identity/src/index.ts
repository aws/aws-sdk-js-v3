/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary
 *          credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a
 *          device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an
 *          application.</p>
 *          <p>Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or
 *          more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon
 *          Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.
 *          Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider
 *          trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
 *          credentials.</p>
 *          <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide
 *          see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html">Authentication Flow</a>.</p>
 *          <p>For more information see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html">Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</a>.</p>
