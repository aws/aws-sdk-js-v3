/**
 * <p>Delete an OpsItem. You must have permission in Identity and Access Management (IAM) to
 *    delete an OpsItem. </p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Note the following important information about this operation.</p>
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Deleting an OpsItem is irreversible. You can't restore a deleted OpsItem.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>This operation uses an <i>eventual consistency model</i>, which means the
 *       system can take a few minutes to complete this operation. If you delete an OpsItem and
 *       immediately call, for example, <a>GetOpsItem</a>, the deleted OpsItem might still
 *       appear in the response. </p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>This operation is idempotent. The system doesn't throw an exception if you repeatedly
 *       call this operation for the same OpsItem. If the first call is successful, all additional calls
 *       return the same successful response as the first call.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>This operation doesn't support cross-account calls. A delegated administrator or
 *       management account can't delete OpsItems in other accounts, even if OpsCenter has been set up for
 *       cross-account administration. For more information about cross-account administration, see
 *        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-setting-up-cross-account.html">Setting up
 *        OpsCenter to centrally manage OpsItems across accounts</a> in the <i>Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ul>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SSMClient, DeleteOpsItemCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ssm"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SSMClient, DeleteOpsItemCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ssm"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SSMClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteOpsItemRequest
 *   OpsItemId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteOpsItemCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteOpsItemCommandInput - {@link DeleteOpsItemCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteOpsItemCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteOpsItemCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteOpsItemCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SSMClientResolvedConfig | config} for SSMClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerError} (server fault)
 *  <p>An error occurred on the server side.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OpsItemInvalidParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A specified parameter argument isn't valid. Verify the available arguments and try
 *    again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link SSMServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from SSM service.</p>
