 *                <b>Powered by Amazon Bedrock</b>: Amazon Web Services implements <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/abuse-detection.html">automated abuse
 *           detection</a>. Because Amazon Q in Connect is built on Amazon Bedrock, users can take full advantage of
 *         the controls implemented in Amazon Bedrock to enforce safety, security, and the responsible use of
 *         artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>Amazon Q in Connect is a generative AI customer service assistant. It is an LLM-enhanced
 *       evolution of Amazon Connect Wisdom that delivers real-time recommendations to help contact
 *       center agents resolve customer issues quickly and accurately.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon Q in Connect automatically detects customer intent during calls and chats using conversational
 *       analytics and natural language understanding (NLU). It then provides agents with immediate,
 *       real-time generative responses and suggested actions, and links to relevant documents and
 *       articles. Agents can also query Amazon Q in Connect directly using natural language or keywords to answer
 *       customer requests.</p>
 *          <p>Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to create an assistant and a knowledge base, for example, or
 *       manage content by uploading custom files.</p>
 *          <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-q-connect.html">Use Amazon Q in Connect for generative AI
