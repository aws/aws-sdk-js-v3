 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public (Amazon ECR Public) is a managed container image registry service. Amazon ECR provides both
 *          public and private registries to host your container images. You can use the Docker CLI or
 *          your preferred client to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable,
 *          and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR
 *          supports public repositories with this API. For information about the Amazon ECR API for private
 *          repositories, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Elastic Container Registry API Reference</a>.</p>
