/**
 * <p>Releases a phone number previously claimed to an Amazon Connect instance or traffic distribution group. You
 *    can call this API only in the Amazon Web Services Region where the number was claimed.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>To release phone numbers from a traffic distribution group, use the <code>ReleasePhoneNumber</code> API, not the
 *     Amazon Connect admin website.</p>
 *             <p>After releasing a phone number, the phone number enters into a cooldown period for up to
 *     180 days. It cannot be searched for or claimed again until the period has ended. If you
 *     accidentally release a phone number, contact Amazon Web Services Support.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently,
 *                 contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from
 *                 claiming and releasing any more numbers until up to 180 days past the oldest number
 *                 released has expired.</p>
 *          <p>By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of active
 *                 phone numbers. If you claim and release phone numbers using
 *                 the UI or API during a rolling 180 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number
 *                 service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 180
 *                 days past the oldest number released has expired. </p>
 *          <p>For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 180
 *                 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the
 *                 200% limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you
 *                 open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ConnectClient, ReleasePhoneNumberCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-connect"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ConnectClient, ReleasePhoneNumberCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-connect"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ConnectClient(config);
 * const input = { // ReleasePhoneNumberRequest
 *   PhoneNumberId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ClientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new ReleasePhoneNumberCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param ReleasePhoneNumberCommandInput - {@link ReleasePhoneNumberCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link ReleasePhoneNumberCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link ReleasePhoneNumberCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link ReleasePhoneNumberCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ConnectClientResolvedConfig | config} for ConnectClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient permissions to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link IdempotencyException} (client fault)
 *  <p>An entity with the same name already exists.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServiceException} (server fault)
 *  <p>Request processing failed because of an error or failure with the service.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>One or more of the specified parameters are not valid.</p>
