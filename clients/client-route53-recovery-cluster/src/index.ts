/**
 * <p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p>
 *          <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to
 * 			recover applications by rerouting traffic across
 * 			Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted
 * 			on a highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five redundant Regional endpoints against which you
 * 			can run API calls to get or update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set
 * 			one routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region
 * 			to another. </p>
 *          <p>
 *             <i>Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations
 * 				to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region
 * 				for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands.
 * 				For more information, see
 * 				<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
 * 					Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p>
 *          <p>This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control states
 * 			in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters, control
 * 			panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about working with routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p>

 *                <p>Route 53 ARC also provides readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make sure that your
 * 					applications are scaled and ready to handle failover traffic. For more information about
 * 					the related API operations, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-readiness/latest/api/">Recovery Readiness API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller</a>.</p>
