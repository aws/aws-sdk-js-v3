/**
 * <p>Set multiple routing control states. You can set the value for each state to be ON or OFF.
 * 			When the state is ON, traffic flows to a cell. When it's OFF, traffic does not
 * 			flow.</p>
 *          <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing controls, which are safeguards for routing
 * 				control state updates that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail open traffic routing. However,
 * 				there are scenarios when you might want to bypass the routing control safeguards that are enforced with
 * 				safety rules that you've configured. For example, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery,
 * 				and one or more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating a routing control state to
 * 				reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you can override one or more safety rules to change
 * 				a routing control state and fail over your application.</p>
 *          <p>The <code>SafetyRulesToOverride</code> property enables you override one or more safety rules and
 * 				update routing control states. For more information, see
 * 				<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.override-safety-rule.html">
 * 					Override safety rules to reroute traffic</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <i>You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster operations
 * 				to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>To see a code example for getting a routing control state, including accessing Regional cluster endpoints
 * 				in sequence, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/service_code_examples_actions.html">API examples</a>
