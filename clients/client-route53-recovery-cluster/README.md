## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript Route53RecoveryCluster Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p>
<p>With Route 53 ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to
recover applications by rerouting traffic across
Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted
on a highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five redundant Regional endpoints against which you
can run API calls to get or update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set
one routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region
to another. </p>
<p>
<i>Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations
to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region
for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands.
For more information, see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p>
<p>This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control states
in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters, control
panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.</p>

<p>Route 53 ARC also provides readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make sure that your
applications are scaled and ready to handle failover traffic. For more information about
the related API operations, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-readiness/latest/api/">Recovery Readiness API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-route53-recovery-cluster
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-route53-recovery-cluster`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-route53-recovery-cluster`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-route53-recovery-cluster`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `Route53RecoveryClusterClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ListRoutingControlsCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const {
  Route53RecoveryClusterClient,
  ListRoutingControlsCommand,
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-route53-recovery-cluster");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { Route53RecoveryClusterClient, ListRoutingControlsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-route53-recovery-cluster";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new Route53RecoveryClusterClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ListRoutingControlsCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-route53-recovery-cluster";
const client = new AWS.Route53RecoveryCluster({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.listRoutingControls(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .listRoutingControls(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.listRoutingControls(params, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
