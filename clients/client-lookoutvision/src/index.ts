 *          accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to identify missing components in an industrial product,
 *          damage to vehicles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects in
 *          silicon wafers â€” or any other physical item where quality is important such as a missing capacitor
 *          on printed circuit boards.</p>
