 * <fullname>Amazon Pinpoint Email Service</fullname>
 *         <p>Welcome to the <i>Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference</i>. This guide provides
 *             information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including supported
 *             operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.</p>
 *         <p>
 *             <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon Pinpoint</a> is an AWS service that you
 *             can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use
 *             Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The
 *             Amazon Pinpoint Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the
 *             email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.</p>
 *         <p>If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon
 *                 Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon Pinpoint Developer
 *                 Guide</i> provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate
 *             how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into
 *             mobile apps and other types of applications. The guide also provides information about
 *             key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply
 *             to using the service.</p>
 *         <p>The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint
 *             for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is
 *             currently available, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">AWS Service Endpoints</a> in
 *             the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>. To learn more about AWS Regions, see
 *                 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS
 *                 Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
 *         <p>In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones
 *             are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency,
 *             high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones
 *             enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also
 *             minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are
 *             available in each Region, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a>.</p>
