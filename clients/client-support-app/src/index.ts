 * <fullname>Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack</fullname>
 *          <p>You can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your support cases in Slack for your
 *       Amazon Web Services account. After you configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Services Support App, you can
 *       perform the following tasks directly in your Slack channel:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Request service quota increases for your account</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that you can chat directly about your
 *           support cases</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>For more information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see the following
 *       documentation in the <i>Amazon Web Services Support User Guide</i>:</p>
