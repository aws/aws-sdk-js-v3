 * <p>
 *           This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API operations.
 *       </p>
 *          <p>
 *          Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data from your live applications, and provides
 *          recommendations that can help you fine-tune your application performance. Using machine learning
 *          algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler can help you find your most expensive lines of code and suggest ways you can
 *          improve efficiency and remove CPU bottlenecks.
 *       </p>
 *          <p>
 *          Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling data to help you identify what code is
 *          running on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.
 *       </p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Amazon CodeGuru Profiler currently supports applications written in all Java virtual machine (JVM)
 *             languages and Python. While CodeGuru Profiler supports both visualizations and recommendations for applications
 *             written in Java, it can also generate visualizations and a subset of recommendations for
 *             applications written in other JVM languages and Python.</p>
