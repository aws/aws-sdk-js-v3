## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript AppConfig Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>AWS AppConfig</fullname>

<p>Use AWS AppConfig, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly deploy
application configurations. AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any
size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with
applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT
devices.</p>

<p>To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production
systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators.
A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you
want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you
provide a schema or a Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The
configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is
valid.</p>

<p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the
deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change
to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for
each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake
time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an
alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p>

<p>AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully
introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production
traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Feature toggle</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new
features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium
subscribers to access paid content. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress
on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the
system.</p>
</li>
</ul>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-appconfig
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-appconfig`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-appconfig`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-appconfig`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `AppConfigClient` and
the commands you need, for example `CreateApplicationCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { AppConfigClient, CreateApplicationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-appconfig");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { AppConfigClient, CreateApplicationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-appconfig";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new AppConfigClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new CreateApplicationCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-appconfig";
const client = new AWS.AppConfig({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.createApplication(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .createApplication(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.createApplication(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
