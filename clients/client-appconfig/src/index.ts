/**
 * <p>Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly
 *          deploy application configurations. AppConfig supports controlled deployments to
 *          applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can
 *          use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers,
 *          mobile applications, or IoT devices.</p>
 *          <p>To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production
 *          systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes
 *          validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the
 *          configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application
 *          configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that runs against
 *          the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the
 *          configuration data is valid.</p>
 *          <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to
 *          ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can
 *          configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes
 *          deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error
 *          monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back
 *          to the previous version. </p>
 *          <p>AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on
 *                new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or
 *                announcement. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to
 *                carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with
 *                production traffic.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow
 *                premium subscribers to access paid content. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to
 *                reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts
 *                the system.</p>
 *             </li>
