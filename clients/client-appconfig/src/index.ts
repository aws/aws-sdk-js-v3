 * <p>AppConfig feature flags and dynamic configurations help software builders
 *          quickly and securely adjust application behavior in production environments without full
 *          code deployments. AppConfig speeds up software release frequency, improves
 *          application resiliency, and helps you address emergent issues more quickly. With feature
 *          flags, you can gradually release new capabilities to users and measure the impact of those
 *          changes before fully deploying the new capabilities to all users. With operational flags
 *          and dynamic configurations, you can update block lists, allow lists, throttling limits,
 *          logging verbosity, and perform other operational tuning to quickly respond to issues in
 *          production environments.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>AppConfig is a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>Despite the fact that application configuration content can vary greatly from
 *          application to application, AppConfig supports the following use cases, which
 *          cover a broad spectrum of customer needs:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Feature flags and toggles</b> - Safely release new
 *                capabilities to your customers in a controlled environment. Instantly roll back
 *                changes if you experience a problem.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Application tuning</b> - Carefully introduce
 *                application changes while testing the impact of those changes with users in
 *                production environments.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Allow list or block list</b> - Control access to
 *                premium features or instantly block specific users without deploying new code.
 *             </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Centralized configuration storage</b> - Keep your
 *                configuration data organized and consistent across all of your workloads. You can use
 *                   AppConfig to deploy configuration data stored in the AppConfig
 *                hosted configuration store, Secrets Manager, Systems Manager, Parameter
 *                Store, or Amazon S3.</p>

 *             <b>How AppConfig works</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>This section provides a high-level description of how AppConfig works and how
 *          you get started.</p>
 *          <dl>
 *             <dt>1. Identify configuration values in code you want to manage in the cloud</dt>
 *             <dd>
 *                <p>Before you start creating AppConfig artifacts, we recommend you
 *                   identify configuration data in your code that you want to dynamically manage using
 *                      AppConfig. Good examples include feature flags or toggles, allow and
 *                   block lists, logging verbosity, service limits, and throttling rules, to name a
 *                   few.</p>
 *                <p>If your configuration data already exists in the cloud, you can take advantage
 *                   of AppConfig validation, deployment, and extension features to further
 *                   streamline configuration data management.</p>
 *             </dd>
 *             <dt>2. Create an application namespace</dt>
 *             <dd>
 *                <p>To create a namespace, you create an AppConfig artifact called an
 *                   application. An application is simply an organizational construct like a
 *                   folder.</p>
 *             </dd>
 *             <dt>3. Create environments</dt>
 *             <dd>
 *                <p>For each AppConfig application, you define one or more environments.
 *                   An environment is a logical grouping of targets, such as applications in a
 *                      <code>Beta</code> or <code>Production</code> environment, Lambda functions,
 *                   or containers. You can also define environments for application subcomponents,
 *                   such as the <code>Web</code>, <code>Mobile</code>, and
 *                   <code>Back-end</code>.</p>
 *                <p>You can configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms for each environment. The system monitors
 *                   alarms during a configuration deployment. If an alarm is triggered, the system
 *                   rolls back the configuration.</p>
 *             </dd>
 *             <dt>4. Create a configuration profile</dt>
 *             <dd>
 *                <p>A configuration profile includes, among other things, a URI that enables
 *                      AppConfig to locate your configuration data in its stored location
 *                   and a profile type. AppConfig supports two configuration profile types:
 *                   feature flags and freeform configurations. Feature flag configuration profiles
 *                   store their data in the AppConfig hosted configuration store and the URI
 *                   is simply <code>hosted</code>. For freeform configuration profiles, you can store
 *                   your data in the AppConfig hosted configuration store or any Amazon Web Services
 *                   service that integrates with AppConfig, as described in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-free-form-configurations-creating.html">Creating
 *                      a free form configuration profile</a> in the the <i>AppConfig User Guide</i>.</p>
 *                <p>A configuration profile can also include optional validators to ensure your
 *                   configuration data is syntactically and semantically correct. AppConfig
 *                   performs a check using the validators when you start a deployment. If any errors
 *                   are detected, the deployment rolls back to the previous configuration data.</p>
 *             </dd>
 *             <dt>5. Deploy configuration data</dt>
 *             <dd>
 *                <p>When you create a new deployment, you specify the following:</p>
 *                <ul>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>An application ID</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>A configuration profile ID</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>A configuration version</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>An environment ID where you want to deploy the configuration data</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>A deployment strategy ID that defines how fast you want the changes to
 *                         take effect</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                </ul>
 *                <p>When you call the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_StartDeployment.html">StartDeployment</a> API action, AppConfig performs the following
 *                   tasks:</p>
 *                <ol>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Retrieves the configuration data from the underlying data store by using
 *                         the location URI in the configuration profile.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Verifies the configuration data is syntactically and semantically correct
 *                         by using the validators you specified when you created your configuration
 *                         profile.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Caches a copy of the data so it is ready to be retrieved by your
 *                         application. This cached copy is called the <i>deployed
 *                            data</i>.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                </ol>
 *             </dd>
 *             <dt>6. Retrieve the configuration</dt>
 *             <dd>
 *                <p>You can configure AppConfig Agent as a local host and have the agent
 *                   poll AppConfig for configuration updates. The agent calls the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_StartConfigurationSession.html">StartConfigurationSession</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_GetLatestConfiguration.html">GetLatestConfiguration</a> API actions and caches your configuration data
 *                   locally. To retrieve the data, your application makes an HTTP call to the
 *                   localhost server. AppConfig Agent supports several use cases, as
 *                   described in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-retrieving-simplified-methods.html">Simplified
 *                      retrieval methods</a> in the the <i>AppConfig User
 *                      Guide</i>.</p>
 *                <p>If AppConfig Agent isn't supported for your use case, you can
 *                   configure your application to poll AppConfig for configuration updates
 *                   by directly calling the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_StartConfigurationSession.html">StartConfigurationSession</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_GetLatestConfiguration.html">GetLatestConfiguration</a> API actions. </p>
