 * <p>This is the <i>Resource Access Manager API Reference</i>. This documentation provides
 *             descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a
 *             service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If
 *             you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you can share your resources with your
 *             entire organization or to organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you
 *             can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users. </p>
 *          <p>To learn more about RAM, see the following resources:</p>
