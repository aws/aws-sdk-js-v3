/**
 * <p>When you attach a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automatically creates
 *             a resource share of <code>featureSet</code>=<code>CREATED_FROM_POLICY</code> with a managed permission that
 *             has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. However, this type
 *             of managed permission is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share can't be modified by
 *             using RAM.</p>
 *          <p>This operation promotes the resource share to a <code>STANDARD</code> resource share that is fully
 *             manageable in RAM. When you promote a resource share, you can then manage the resource share in RAM and
 *             it becomes visible to all of the principals you shared it with.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Before you perform this operation, you should first run <a>PromotePermissionCreatedFromPolicy</a>to ensure that you have an
 *                 appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with this resource share after its is promoted. If
 *                 this operation can't find a managed permission that exactly matches the existing
 *                     <code>CREATED_FROM_POLICY</code> permission, then this operation fails.</p>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { RAMClient, PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ram"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { RAMClient, PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ram"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new RAMClient(config);
 * const input = { // PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicyRequest
 *   resourceShareArn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicyResponse
 * //   returnValue: true || false,
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *

 * @throws {@link InvalidParameterException} (client fault)

 * @throws {@link InvalidStateTransitionException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because the requested operation isn't valid for the resource

 * @throws {@link MalformedArnException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because the specified <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Name (ARN)</a> has a format that isn't
 *             valid.</p>

 * @throws {@link MissingRequiredParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because a required input parameter is missing.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OperationNotPermittedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because the requested operation isn't permitted.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceShareLimitExceededException} (client fault)

 *
 * @throws {@link ServerInternalException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because the service could not respond to the request due to an
 *             internal problem. Try again later.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceUnavailableException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because the service isn't available. Try again later.</p>

 *  <p>There isn't an existing managed permission defined in RAM that has the same IAM permissions as
 *             the resource-based policy attached to the resource. You should first run <a>PromotePermissionCreatedFromPolicy</a> to create that managed permission.</p>
