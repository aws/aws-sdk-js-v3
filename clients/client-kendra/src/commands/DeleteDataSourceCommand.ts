/**
 * Deletes an Amazon Kendra data source connector. An exception is not thrown if the data source is already being deleted. While the data source is being deleted, the `Status` field returned by a call to the `DescribeDataSource` API is set to `DELETING`. For more information, see [Deleting Data Sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/delete-data-source.html).
 *
 * Deleting an entire data source or re-syncing your index after deleting specific documents from a data source could take up to an hour or more, depending on the number of documents you want to delete.
 *
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { KendraClient, DeleteDataSourceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-kendra"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { KendraClient, DeleteDataSourceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-kendra"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { KendraClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-kendra";
 * const config = {}; // type is KendraClientConfig
 * const client = new KendraClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteDataSourceRequest
 *   Id: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   IndexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDataSourceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteDataSourceCommandInput - {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link KendraClientResolvedConfig | config} for KendraClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *
 * You don't have sufficient access to perform this action. Please ensure you have the required permission policies and user accounts and try again.
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *
 * A conflict occurred with the request. Please fix any inconsistences with your resources and try again.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *
 * An issue occurred with the internal server used for your Amazon Kendra service. Please wait a few minutes and try again, or contact [Support](http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) for help.
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *
 * The resource you want to use doesn’t exist. Please check you have provided the correct resource and try again.
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *
 * The request was denied due to request throttling. Please reduce the number of requests and try again.
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *
 * The input fails to satisfy the constraints set by the Amazon Kendra service. Please provide the correct input and try again.
 *
 * @throws {@link KendraServiceException}
 *
 * Base exception class for all service exceptions from Kendra service.
