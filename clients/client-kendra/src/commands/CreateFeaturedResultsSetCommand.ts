/**
 * <p>Creates a set of featured results to display at the top of the search results page.
 *             Featured results are placed above all other results for certain queries. You map
 *             specific queries to specific documents for featuring in the results. If a query
 *             contains an exact match, then one or more specific documents are featured in the
 *             search results.</p>
 *          <p>You can create up to 50 sets of featured results per index. You can request to
 *             increase this limit by contacting <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">Support</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { KendraClient, CreateFeaturedResultsSetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-kendra"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { KendraClient, CreateFeaturedResultsSetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-kendra"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new KendraClient(config);
 * const input = { // CreateFeaturedResultsSetRequest
 *   IndexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   FeaturedResultsSetName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   Description: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ClientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   Status: "ACTIVE" || "INACTIVE",
 *   QueryTexts: [ // QueryTextList
 *     "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ],
 *   FeaturedDocuments: [ // FeaturedDocumentList
 *     { // FeaturedDocument
 *       Id: "STRING_VALUE",
 *     },
 *   ],
 *   Tags: [ // TagList
 *     { // Tag
 *       Key: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *       Value: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *     },
 *   ],
 * };
 * const command = new CreateFeaturedResultsSetCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // CreateFeaturedResultsSetResponse
 * //   FeaturedResultsSet: { // FeaturedResultsSet
 * //     FeaturedResultsSetId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     FeaturedResultsSetName: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     Description: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     Status: "ACTIVE" || "INACTIVE",
