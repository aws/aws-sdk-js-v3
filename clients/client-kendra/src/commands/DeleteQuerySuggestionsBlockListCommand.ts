 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.

 * const client = new KendraClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteQuerySuggestionsBlockListRequest
 *   IndexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   Id: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteQuerySuggestionsBlockListCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
