 * <fullname>Amazon WorkSpaces Service</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft Windows
 *          or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as <i>WorkSpaces</i>.
 *             WorkSpaces eliminates the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex
 *          software. You can quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can access their
 *          virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.</p>
 *          <p>This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
 *          parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information about the
 *          supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Amazon WorkSpaces service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/wsp.html">WorkSpaces endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services
 *             General Reference</i>.</p>
 *          <p>You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using the WorkSpaces
 *          console, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs. For more information about
 *          administering WorkSpaces, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/">Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide</a>.
 *          For more information about using the Amazon WorkSpaces client application or web
 *          browser to access provisioned WorkSpaces, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/">Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide</a>. For more
 *          information about using the CLI to manage your WorkSpaces resources,
 *          see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces/index.html">WorkSpaces section of the CLI Reference</a>.</p>
