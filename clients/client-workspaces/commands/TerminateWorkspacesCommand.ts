/**
 * <p>Terminates the specified WorkSpaces.</p>
 *
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Terminating a WorkSpace is a permanent action and cannot be undone. The user's data is
 *             destroyed. If you need to archive any user data, contact AWS Support before
 *             terminating the WorkSpace.</p>
 *          </important>
 *
 *          <p>You can terminate a WorkSpace that is in any state except <code>SUSPENDED</code>.</p>
 *          <p>This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely
 *          terminated. After a WorkSpace is terminated, the <code>TERMINATED</code> state is returned
 *          only briefly before the WorkSpace directory metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely
 *          returned. To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the WorkSpace ID by using
 *          <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaces.html">
 *             DescribeWorkSpaces</a>. If the WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has
 *          been successfully terminated.</p>
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of charge to use with WorkSpaces.
 *             If there are no WorkSpaces being used with your Simple AD or AD Connector directory for 30
 *             consecutive days, this directory will be automatically deregistered for use with Amazon WorkSpaces,
 *             and you will be charged for this directory as per the
 *             <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/pricing/">AWS Directory Services pricing terms</a>.</p>
 *
 *             <p>To delete empty directories, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/delete-workspaces-directory.html">
 *                Delete the Directory for Your WorkSpaces</a>. If you delete your
 *             Simple AD or AD Connector directory, you can always create a new one when you want to start using
 *             WorkSpaces again.</p>
