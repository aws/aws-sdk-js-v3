/**
 * <p>Welcome to the <i>AWS Entity Resolution API Reference</i>.</p>
 *          <p>AWS Entity Resolution is an AWS service that provides pre-configured entity resolution capabilities
 *          that enable developers and analysts at advertising and marketing companies to build an accurate and
 *         complete view of their consumers.</p>
 *          <p>
 *          With AWS Entity Resolution, you have the ability to match source records containing consumer identifiers,
 *          such as name, email address, and phone number. This holds true even when these records have incomplete or
 *          conflicting identifiers. For example, AWS Entity Resolution can effectively match a source record from a
 *          customer relationship management (CRM) system, which includes account information like first name, last name,
 *          postal address, phone number, and email address, with a source record from a marketing system containing
 *          campaign information, such as username and email address.</p>
 *          <p>To learn more about AWS Entity Resolution concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the
 *          <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/entityresolution/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html">AWS Entity Resolution
 *             User Guide</a>.</p>
