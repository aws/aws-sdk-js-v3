/**
 * <p>Welcome to the <i>Entity Resolution API Reference</i>.</p>
 *          <p>Entity Resolution is an Amazon Web Services service that provides pre-configured entity
 *          resolution capabilities that enable developers and analysts at advertising and marketing
 *          companies to build an accurate and complete view of their consumers.</p>
 *          <p> With Entity Resolution, you can match source records containing consumer identifiers,
 *          such as name, email address, and phone number. This is true even when these records have
 *          incomplete or conflicting identifiers. For example, Entity Resolution can effectively match
 *          a source record from a customer relationship management (CRM) system with a source record
 *          from a marketing system containing campaign information.</p>
 *          <p>To learn more about Entity Resolution concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/entityresolution/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html">Entity Resolution User Guide</a>.</p>
