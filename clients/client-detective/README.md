## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript Detective Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and
investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically
extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from
AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by
Amazon GuardDuty.</p>
<p>The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A
behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created
and managed by a master account.</p>
<p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs
that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.</p>
<p>A Detective master account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add member accounts to a behavior graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove their account from a behavior graph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-detective
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-detective`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-detective`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-detective`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `DetectiveClient` and
the commands you need, for example `AcceptInvitationCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { DetectiveClient, AcceptInvitationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-detective");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { DetectiveClient, AcceptInvitationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-detective";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new DetectiveClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new AcceptInvitationCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-detective";
const client = new AWS.Detective({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.acceptInvitation(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .acceptInvitation(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.acceptInvitation(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
