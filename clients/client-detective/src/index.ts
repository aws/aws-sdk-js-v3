/**
 * <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you to
 *          analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such
 *          as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by
 *             Amazon GuardDuty.</p>
 *          <p>The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior
 *          graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is
 *          created and managed by an administrator account.</p>
 *          <p>To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account sends an
 *          invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation, it becomes a member
 *          account in the behavior graph.</p>
 *          <p>Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization
 *          management account designates the Detective administrator account for the
 *          organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior
 *          graph. The Detective administrator account is also the delegated administrator
 *          account for Detective in Organizations.</p>
 *          <p>The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account as a
 *          member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization accounts do not receive
 *          invitations. The Detective administrator account can also invite other accounts to
 *          the organization behavior graph.</p>
 *          <p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage
 *          behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected
 *          endpoint.</p>
 *          <p>The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do
 *          the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
 *                behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Add member accounts to a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Apply tags to a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the
 *          delegated administrator for Detective.</p>
 *          <p>The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as member
 *                accounts in the organization behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Remove their account from a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An
 *             administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of
 *                Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior
 *             graph.</p>
