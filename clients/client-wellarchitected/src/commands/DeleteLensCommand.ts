/**
 * <p>Delete an existing lens.</p>
 *          <p>Only the owner of a lens can delete it.  After the lens is deleted,  Amazon Web Services accounts and users
 *               that you shared the lens with can continue to use it, but they will no longer be able to apply it to new workloads.
 *         </p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>
 *                <b>Disclaimer</b>
 *             </p>
 *             <p>By sharing your custom lenses with other Amazon Web Services accounts,
 *                 you acknowledge that Amazon Web Services will make your custom lenses available to those
 *                 other accounts. Those other accounts may continue to access and use your
 *                 shared custom lenses even if you delete the custom lenses
 *                 from your own Amazon Web Services account or terminate
 *                 your Amazon Web Services account.</p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.

 * // const { WellArchitectedClient, DeleteLensCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-wellarchitected"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new WellArchitectedClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteLensInput
 *   LensAlias: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ClientRequestToken: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   LensStatus: "ALL" || "DRAFT" || "PUBLISHED", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteLensCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
