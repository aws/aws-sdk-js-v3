 * <p>With Service Quotas, you can view and manage your quotas easily as your Amazon Web Services workloads grow.
 *             Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum number of resources that you can
 *             create in your Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/">Service Quotas User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>You need Amazon Web Services CLI version 2.13.20 or higher to view and manage resource-level quotas such as <code>Instances
 *         per domain</code> for Amazon OpenSearch Service.</p>
