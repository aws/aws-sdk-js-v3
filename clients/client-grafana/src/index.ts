 * <p>Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization service that
 *             you can use to instantly query, correlate, and visualize operational metrics, logs, and
 *             traces from multiple sources. Amazon Managed Grafana makes it easy to deploy, operate, and
 *             scale Grafana, a widely deployed data visualization tool that is popular for its
 *             extensible data support.</p>
 *          <p>With Amazon Managed Grafana, you create logically isolated Grafana servers called
 *                 <i>workspaces</i>. In a workspace, you can create Grafana dashboards
 *             and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces without having to build,
 *             package, or deploy any hardware to run Grafana servers. </p>
