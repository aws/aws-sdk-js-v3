/**
 * <p>This operation deletes a vault. Amazon S3 Glacier will delete a vault only if there are
 *          no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and there have been no writes to the
 *          vault since the last inventory. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault
 *          deletion fails (that is, the vault is not removed) and Amazon S3 Glacier returns an error. You
 *          can use <a>DescribeVault</a> to return the number of archives in a vault, and
 *          you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html">Initiate a Job (POST
 *             jobs)</a> to initiate a new inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory contains
 *          the archive IDs you use to delete archives using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-delete.html">Delete Archive (DELETE
 *             archive)</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>This operation is idempotent.</p>
 *
 *          <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS
 *          Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must
 *          grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html">Access Control Using
 *             AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>.</p>
 *          <p> For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/deleting-vaults.html">Deleting a Vault in Amazon
 *             Glacier</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vault-delete.html">Delete Vault </a> in the
 *             <i>Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide</i>. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GlacierClient, DeleteVaultCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-glacier"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GlacierClient, DeleteVaultCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-glacier"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { GlacierClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-glacier";
 * const config = {}; // type is GlacierClientConfig
 * const client = new GlacierClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteVaultInput
 *   accountId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   vaultName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteVaultCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteVaultCommandInput - {@link DeleteVaultCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteVaultCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteVaultCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteVaultCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GlacierClientResolvedConfig | config} for GlacierClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidParameterValueException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Returned if a parameter of the request is incorrectly specified.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link MissingParameterValueException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Returned if a required header or parameter is missing from the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Returned if the specified resource (such as a vault, upload ID, or job ID) doesn't
 *          exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceUnavailableException} (server fault)
 *  <p>Returned if the service cannot complete the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link GlacierServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from Glacier service.</p>
 *
 *
 * @example To delete a vault
 * ```javascript
 * // The example deletes a vault named my-vault:
 * const input = {
 *   accountId: "-",
 *   vaultName: "my-vault"
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteVaultCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * /* response is
