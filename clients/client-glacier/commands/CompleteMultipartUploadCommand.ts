/**
 * <p>You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been
 *          uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts.
 *          After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path
 *          of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive.
 *          After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the
 *          archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive
 *          IDs in a vault. For more information, see <a>InitiateJob</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive
 *          you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing
 *             Checksums</a>. On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree
 *          hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the
 *          vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The <a>ListParts</a> operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific
 *          multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used
 *          to debug a bad checksum issue.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when
 *          assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an
 *          error and the operation fails.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful
 *          complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the
 *          operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you
 *          experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error,
 *          in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same
 *          archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart
 *          upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will
 *          not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is
 *          possible.</p>
 *
 *          <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS
 *          Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must
 *          grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html">Access Control Using
 *             AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>.</p>
 *          <p> For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/uploading-archive-mpu.html">Uploading Large Archives in
 *             Parts (Multipart Upload)</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-multipart-complete-upload.html">Complete Multipart
 *             Upload</a> in the <i>Amazon Glacier Developer Guide</i>. </p>
