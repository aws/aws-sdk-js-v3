/**
 * <p>This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any
 *          order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a
 *          multipart upload.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is
 *          true:</p>
 *
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>SHA256 tree hash does not match</b>To ensure that part
 *                data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and
 *                include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also
 *                computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the operation fails.
 *                For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing
 *                   Checksums</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Part size does not match</b>The size of each part except
 *                the last must match the size specified in the corresponding <a>InitiateMultipartUpload</a> request. The size of the last part must be the
 *                same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.</p>
 *                <note>
 *                   <p>If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified
 *                   in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then
 *                   the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart
 *                   Upload request will fail.</p>
 *                </note>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Range does not align</b>The byte range value in the
 *                request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate
 *                request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to
 *                4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part
 *                ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align
 *                with the part size and the upload will fail. </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *
 *          <p>This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data
 *          included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.</p>
 *
 *          <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS
 *          Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must
 *          grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html">Access Control Using
 *             AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>.</p>
 *          <p> For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/uploading-archive-mpu.html">Uploading Large Archives in
