/**
 * <p>This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and jobs
 *          that have recently finished. The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation
 *          time.</p>
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them;
 *             however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be
 *             retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed
 *             enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or
 *             your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive
 *             retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the
 *             archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the
 *             archive while the job exists.</p>
 *          </note>
 *
 *          <p>The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response <code>Marker</code> field.
 *          If there are no more jobs to list, the <code>Marker</code> field is set to <code>null</code>. If there are more jobs to list,
 *          the <code>Marker</code> field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list.
 *          To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job,
 *          set the marker request parameter to the <code>Marker</code> value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request.</p>
 *
 *          <p>You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by
 *          specifying the <code>limit</code> parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The
 *          number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs
 *          never exceeds the limit.</p>
 *
 *         <p>Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional
 *             <code>statuscode</code> parameter or <code>completed</code> parameter, or both. Using
 *          the <code>statuscode</code> parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match
 *          either the <code>InProgress</code>, <code>Succeeded</code>, or <code>Failed</code> status.
 *          Using the <code>completed</code> parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were
 *          completed (<code>true</code>) or jobs that were not completed
 *          (<code>false</code>).</p>
 *
 *          <p>For more information about using this operation,
 *          see the documentation for the underlying REST API <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-jobs-get.html">List Jobs</a>. </p>
