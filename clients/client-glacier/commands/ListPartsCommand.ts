/**
 * <p>This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a specific
 *          multipart upload. You can make this request at any time during an in-progress multipart
 *          upload before you complete the upload (see <a>CompleteMultipartUpload</a>. List
 *          Parts returns an error for completed uploads. The list returned in the List Parts response
 *          is sorted by part range. </p>
 *
 *          <p>The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up
 *          to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always check the response for a
 *             <code>marker</code> at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the
 *             <code>marker</code> is <code>null</code>. To return a list of parts that begins at a
 *          specific part, set the <code>marker</code> request parameter to the value you obtained from
 *          a previous List Parts request. You can also limit the number of parts returned in the
 *          response by specifying the <code>limit</code> parameter in the request. </p>
 *
 *          <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS
 *          Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must
 *          grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see
