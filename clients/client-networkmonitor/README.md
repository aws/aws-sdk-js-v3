# @aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor

## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript NetworkMonitor Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active network monitoring
service that identifies if a network issues exists within the Amazon Web Services network
or your own company network.  Within Network Monitor you'll choose the source VPCs and
subnets from the Amazon Web Services network in which you operate and then you'll choose
the destination IP addresses from your on-premises network. From these sources and
destinations, Network Monitor creates a monitor containing all the possible source and
destination combinations, each of which is called a probe, within a single monitor.
These probes then monitor network traffic to help you identify where network issues might be affecting your traffic.</p>
<p>Before you begin, ensure the Amazon Web Services CLI is configured in the Amazon Web Services Account where you will create the Network Monitor resource. Network
Monitor doesnâ€™t support creation on cross-account resources, but you can create a
Network Monitor in any subnet belonging to a VPC owned by your Account.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/what-is-network-monitor.html">Using Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p>

## Installing

To install this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `NetworkMonitorClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ListMonitorsCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { NetworkMonitorClient, ListMonitorsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { NetworkMonitorClient, ListMonitorsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new NetworkMonitorClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ListMonitorsCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-networkmonitor";
const client = new AWS.NetworkMonitor({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.listMonitors(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .listMonitors(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.listMonitors(params, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
