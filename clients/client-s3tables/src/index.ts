/**
 * <p>An Amazon S3 table represents a structured dataset consisting of tabular data in <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/docs/">Apache Parquet</a> format and related metadata. This data is stored inside an S3 table as a subresource. All tables in a table bucket are stored in the <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/">Apache Iceberg</a> table format. Through integration with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.html">AWS Glue Data Catalog</a> you can interact with your tables using AWS analytics services, such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon Athena</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>. Amazon S3 manages maintenance of your tables through automatic file compaction and snapshot management. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-buckets.html">Amazon S3 table buckets</a>.</p>
