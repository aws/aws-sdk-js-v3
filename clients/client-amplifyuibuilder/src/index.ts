 * <p>The Amplify UI Builder API provides a programmatic interface for creating
 *       and configuring user interface (UI) component libraries and themes for use in your Amplify applications. You can then connect these UI components to an application's
 *       backend Amazon Web Services resources.</p>
 *          <p>You can also use the Amplify Studio visual designer to create UI components
 *       and model data for an app. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/intro">Introduction</a> in the
 *       <i>Amplify Docs</i>.</p>
 *          <p>The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and
 *       documentation for client app development. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/">Amplify Framework</a>. For more information about
 *       deploying an Amplify application to Amazon Web Services, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html">Amplify User Guide</a>.</p>
