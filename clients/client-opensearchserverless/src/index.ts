 * <p>Use the Amazon OpenSearch Serverless API to create, configure, and manage OpenSearch Serverless collections and
 *             security policies.</p>
 *          <p>OpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand, pre-provisioned serverless configuration for
 *             Amazon OpenSearch Service. OpenSearch Serverless removes the operational complexities of provisioning,
 *             configuring, and tuning your OpenSearch clusters. It enables you to easily search and
 *             analyze petabytes of data without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure
 *             and data management.</p>
 *          <p> To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-overview.html">What is
 *                 Amazon OpenSearch Serverless?</a>
