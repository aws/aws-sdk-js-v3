/**
 * Deletes a run and returns a response with no body if the operation is successful. You can only delete a run that has reached a `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED` stage. A completed run has delivered an output, or was cancelled and resulted in no output. When you delete a run, only the metadata associated with the run is deleted. The run outputs remain in Amazon S3 and logs remain in CloudWatch.
 *
 * To verify that the workflow is deleted:
 *
 * - Use `ListRuns` to confirm the workflow no longer appears in the list.
 * - Use `GetRun` to verify the workflow cannot be found.
 *
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { OmicsClient, DeleteRunCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-omics"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { OmicsClient, DeleteRunCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-omics"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { OmicsClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-omics";
 * const config = {}; // type is OmicsClientConfig
 * const client = new OmicsClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteRunRequest
 *   id: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteRunCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteRunCommandInput - {@link DeleteRunCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteRunCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteRunCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteRunCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link OmicsClientResolvedConfig | config} for OmicsClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *
 * You do not have sufficient access to perform this action.
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *
 * The request cannot be applied to the target resource in its current state.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *
 * An unexpected error occurred. Try the request again.
 *
 * @throws {@link RequestTimeoutException} (client fault)
 *
 * The request timed out.
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *
 * The target resource was not found in the current Region.
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceQuotaExceededException} (client fault)
 *
 * The request exceeds a service quota.
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *
 * The request was denied due to request throttling.
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *
 * The input fails to satisfy the constraints specified by an Amazon Web Services service.
 *
 * @throws {@link OmicsServiceException}
 *
 * Base exception class for all service exceptions from Omics service.
