 * <p>Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes
 *       everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private servers),
 *       container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP
 *       addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of
 *       registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly
 *       price.</p>
 *          <p>You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API,
 *         Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail
 *       concepts and tasks, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
