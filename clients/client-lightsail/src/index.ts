 * <p>Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes
 *       everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private servers),
 *       container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP
 *       addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of
 *       registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly
 *       price.</p>
 *          <p>You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API,
 *         Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail
 *       concepts and tasks, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/lightsail-how-to-set-up-and-configure-aws-cli">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
 *       parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the supported
 *         Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service, see
