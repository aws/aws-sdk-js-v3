/**
 * <p>Amazon Web Services IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capability for validating IoT
 *             devices during device software development. Device Advisor provides pre-built tests that you
 *             can use to validate IoT devices for reliable and secure connectivity with Amazon Web Services IoT Core
 *             before deploying devices to production. By using Device Advisor, you can confirm that your
 *             devices can connect to Amazon Web Services IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if applicable,
 *             receive software updates from IoT Device Management. You can also download signed
 *             qualification reports to submit to the Amazon Web Services Partner Network to get your device
 *             qualified for the Amazon Web Services Partner Device Catalog without the need to send your device in
 *             and wait for it to be tested.</p>
