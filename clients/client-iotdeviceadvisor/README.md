# @aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor

## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript IotDeviceAdvisor Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Amazon Web Services IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capability for validating IoT
devices during device software development. Device Advisor provides pre-built tests that you
can use to validate IoT devices for reliable and secure connectivity with Amazon Web Services IoT Core
before deploying devices to production. By using Device Advisor, you can confirm that your
devices can connect to Amazon Web Services IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if applicable,
receive software updates from IoT Device Management. You can also download signed
qualification reports to submit to the Amazon Web Services Partner Network to get your device
qualified for the Amazon Web Services Partner Device Catalog without the need to send your device in
and wait for it to be tested.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `IotDeviceAdvisorClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ListSuiteRunsCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { IotDeviceAdvisorClient, ListSuiteRunsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { IotDeviceAdvisorClient, ListSuiteRunsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new IotDeviceAdvisorClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ListSuiteRunsCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-iotdeviceadvisor";
const client = new AWS.IotDeviceAdvisor({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.listSuiteRuns(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .listSuiteRuns(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.listSuiteRuns(params, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
