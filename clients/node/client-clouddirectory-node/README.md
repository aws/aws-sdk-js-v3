## Description

<fullname>Amazon Cloud Directory</fullname> <p>Amazon Cloud Directory is a component of the AWS Directory Service that simplifies the development and management of cloud-scale web, mobile, and IoT applications. This guide describes the Cloud Directory operations that you can call programmatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors. For information about Cloud Directory features, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">AWS Directory Service</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clouddirectory/latest/developerguide/what_is_cloud_directory.html">Amazon Cloud Directory Developer Guide</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`CloudDirectoryClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AddFacetToObjectCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  CloudDirectoryClient,
  AddFacetToObjectCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  CloudDirectoryClient,
  AddFacetToObjectCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const cloudDirectory = new CloudDirectoryClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  DirectoryArn: /**a string value*/,
  SchemaFacet: { /**an object specifying SchemaFacet*/ },
  ObjectReference: { /**an object specifying ObjectReference*/ },
};
const addFacetToObjectCommand = new AddFacetToObjectCommand(params);
cloudDirectory.send(addFacetToObjectCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await cloudDirectory.send(addFacetToObjectCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
cloudDirectory.send(addFacetToObjectCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory-node";
const cloudDirectory = new AWS.CloudDirectory({ region: "region" });
cloudDirectory.addFacetToObject(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await cloudDirectory.send(addFacetToObjectCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
