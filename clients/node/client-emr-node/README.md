## Description

<p>Amazon EMR is a web service that makes it easy to process large amounts of data efficiently. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop processing combined with several AWS products to do tasks such as web indexing, data mining, log file analysis, machine learning, scientific simulation, and data warehousing.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-emr-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`EMRClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AddInstanceFleetCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  EMRClient,
  AddInstanceFleetCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-emr-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import { EMRClient, AddInstanceFleetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-emr-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const eMR = new EMRClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  ClusterId: /**a string value*/,
  InstanceFleet: { /**an object specifying InstanceFleet*/ },
};
const addInstanceFleetCommand = new AddInstanceFleetCommand(params);
eMR.send(addInstanceFleetCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await eMR.send(addInstanceFleetCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
eMR.send(addInstanceFleetCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-emr-node";
const eMR = new AWS.EMR({ region: "region" });
eMR.addInstanceFleet(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await eMR.send(addInstanceFleetCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
