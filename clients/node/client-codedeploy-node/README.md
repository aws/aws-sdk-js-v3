## Description

<fullname>AWS CodeDeploy</fullname> <p>AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility, serverless AWS Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service.</p> <p>You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy.</p> <p>AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual deployments.</p> <p> <b>AWS CodeDeploy Components</b> </p> <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following AWS CodeDeploy components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Application</b>: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment group</b>: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application revisions</b>: For an AWS Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.</p> <p> <b>AWS CodeDeploy Information Resources</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide">AWS CodeDeploy User Guide</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/">AWS CodeDeploy API Reference Guide</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/index.html">AWS CLI Reference for AWS CodeDeploy</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=179">AWS CodeDeploy Developer Forum</a> </p> </li> </ul>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-codedeploy-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`CodeDeployClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  CodeDeployClient,
  AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  CodeDeployClient,
  AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const codeDeploy = new CodeDeployClient({ region: "region" });
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  tags: [
    /**a list of structure*/
  ],
  instanceNames: [
    /**a list of string*/
  ]
};
const addTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand = new AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand(
  params
);
codeDeploy
  .send(addTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand)
  .then(data => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // error handling
  });
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await codeDeploy.send(addTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
codeDeploy.send(addTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy-node";
const codeDeploy = new AWS.CodeDeploy({ region: "region" });
codeDeploy.addTagsToOnPremisesInstances(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await codeDeploy.send(addTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
