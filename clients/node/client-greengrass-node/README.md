## Description

AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS onto physical devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. AWS IoT Greengrass ensures your devices can respond quickly to local events and operate with intermittent connectivity. AWS IoT Greengrass minimizes the cost of transmitting data to the cloud by allowing you to author AWS Lambda functions that execute locally.

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-greengrass-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`GreengrassClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AssociateRoleToGroupCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  GreengrassClient,
  AssociateRoleToGroupCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-greengrass-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  GreengrassClient,
  AssociateRoleToGroupCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-greengrass-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const greengrass = new GreengrassClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  GroupId: /**a string value*/,
  RoleArn: /**a string value*/,
};
const associateRoleToGroupCommand = new AssociateRoleToGroupCommand(params);
greengrass.send(associateRoleToGroupCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await greengrass.send(associateRoleToGroupCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
greengrass.send(associateRoleToGroupCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-greengrass-node";
const greengrass = new AWS.Greengrass({ region: "region" });
greengrass.associateRoleToGroup(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await greengrass.send(associateRoleToGroupCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
