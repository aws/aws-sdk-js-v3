Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html">AWS::Include</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html">AWS::Serverless</a> transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.</p> <p>Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros <i>and</i> nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.</p> <important> <p>You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.</p> <p>Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified.</p> </important> <p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html">Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates</a>.</p> </li> </ul>
