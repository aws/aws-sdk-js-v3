## Description

<fullname>AWS Lambda</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is the <i>AWS Lambda API Reference</i>. The AWS Lambda Developer Guide provides additional information. For the service overview, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What is AWS Lambda</a>, and for information about how the service works, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html">AWS Lambda: How it Works</a> in the <b>AWS Lambda Developer Guide</b>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-lambda-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`LambdaClient`) and the commands you need, for example `InvokeAsyncCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  LambdaClient,
  InvokeAsyncCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-lambda-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import { LambdaClient, InvokeAsyncCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lambda-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const lambda = new LambdaClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  FunctionName: /**a string value*/,
  InvokeArgs: /**a blob value*/
  /**You can supply readable stream to streaming input. e.g. fs.createReadStream(file) */,
};
const invokeAsyncCommand = new InvokeAsyncCommand(params);
lambda.send(invokeAsyncCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await lambda.send(invokeAsyncCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
lambda.send(invokeAsyncCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-lambda-node";
const lambda = new AWS.Lambda({ region: "region" });
lambda.invokeAsync(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await lambda.send(invokeAsyncCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
