## Description

<p>The Cost Explorer API enables you to programmatically query your cost and usage data. You can query for aggregated data such as total monthly costs or total daily usage. You can also query for granular data, such as the number of daily write operations for Amazon DynamoDB database tables in your production environment. </p> <p>Service Endpoint</p> <p>The Cost Explorer API provides the following endpoint:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about costs associated with the Cost Explorer API, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/">AWS Cost Management Pricing</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-cost-explorer-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`CostExplorerClient`) and the commands you need, for example `GetCostAndUsageCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  CostExplorerClient,
  GetCostAndUsageCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-cost-explorer-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  CostExplorerClient,
  GetCostAndUsageCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-cost-explorer-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const costExplorer = new CostExplorerClient({ region: "region" });
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  TimePeriod: {
    /**an object specifying TimePeriod*/
  }
};
const getCostAndUsageCommand = new GetCostAndUsageCommand(params);
costExplorer
  .send(getCostAndUsageCommand)
  .then(data => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // error handling
  });
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await costExplorer.send(getCostAndUsageCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
costExplorer.send(getCostAndUsageCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-cost-explorer-node";
const costExplorer = new AWS.CostExplorer({ region: "region" });
costExplorer.getCostAndUsage(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await costExplorer.send(getCostAndUsageCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
