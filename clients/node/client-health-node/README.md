## Description

<fullname>AWS Health</fullname> <p>The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that is presented in the <a href="https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a>. You can get information about events that affect your AWS resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEvents</a>: Summary information about events.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEventDetails</a>: Detailed information about one or more events.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeAffectedEntities</a>: Information about AWS resources that are affected by one or more events.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, these operations provide information about event types and summary counts of events or affected entities:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEventTypes</a>: Information about the kinds of events that AWS Health tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEventAggregates</a>: A count of the number of events that meet specified criteria.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEntityAggregates</a>: A count of the number of affected entities that meet specified criteria.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>. Calling the Health API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan causes a <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code>. </p> <p>For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html">AWS Health User Guide</a> for information about how to use the API.</p> <p> <b>Service Endpoint</b> </p> <p>The HTTP endpoint for the AWS Health API is:</p> <ul> <li> <p>https://health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com </p> </li> </ul>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-health-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`HealthClient`) and the commands you need, for example `DescribeAffectedEntitiesCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  HealthClient,
  DescribeAffectedEntitiesCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-health-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  HealthClient,
  DescribeAffectedEntitiesCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-health-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const health = new HealthClient({ region: "region" });
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  filter: {
    /**an object specifying filter*/
  }
};
const describeAffectedEntitiesCommand = new DescribeAffectedEntitiesCommand(
  params
);
health
  .send(describeAffectedEntitiesCommand)
  .then(data => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // error handling
  });
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await health.send(describeAffectedEntitiesCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
health.send(describeAffectedEntitiesCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-health-node";
const health = new AWS.Health({ region: "region" });
health.describeAffectedEntities(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await health.send(describeAffectedEntitiesCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
