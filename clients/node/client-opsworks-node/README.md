## Description

<fullname>AWS OpsWorks</fullname> <p>Welcome to the <i>AWS OpsWorks Stacks API Reference</i>. This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for AWS OpsWorks Stacks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes. </p> <p>AWS OpsWorks Stacks is an application management service that provides an integrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle. For information about this product, go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/">AWS OpsWorks</a> details page. </p> <p> <b>SDKs and CLI</b> </p> <p>The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks Stacks API is by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">AWS CLI</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/opsworks/AWSOpsWorksClient.html">AWS SDK for Java</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_OpsWorks.htm">AWS SDK for .NET</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.OpsWorks.OpsWorksClient.html">AWS SDK for PHP 2</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/">AWS SDK for Ruby</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjavascript/">AWS SDK for Node.js</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/opsworks.html">AWS SDK for Python(Boto)</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS OpsWorks Stacks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Stacks can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li> <p>opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com (API only; not available in the AWS console)</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Chef Versions</b> </p> <p>When you call <a>CreateStack</a>, <a>CloneStack</a>, or <a>UpdateStack</a> we recommend you use the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html">Chef Versions</a>.</p> <note> <p>You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as possible.</p> </note>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-opsworks-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`OpsWorksClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AssignInstanceCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  OpsWorksClient
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-opsworks-node/OpsWorksClient");
const {
  AssignInstanceCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-opsworks-node/commands/AssignInstanceCommand");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import { OpsWorksClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-opsworks-node/OpsWorksClient";
import { AssignInstanceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-opsworks-node/commands/AssignInstanceCommand";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const opsWorks = new OpsWorksClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  InstanceId: /**a string value*/,
  LayerIds: [ /**a list of string*/ ],
};
const assignInstanceCommand = new AssignInstanceCommand(params);
opsWorks.send(assignInstanceCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await opsWorks.send(assignInstanceCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
opsWorks.send(assignInstanceCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/@aws-sdk/client-opsworks-node/OpsWorks";
const opsWorks = new AWS.OpsWorks({ region: "region" });
opsWorks.assignInstance(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await opsWorks.send(assignInstanceCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
