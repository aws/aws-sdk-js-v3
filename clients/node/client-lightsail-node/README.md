## Description

<p>Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers who just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, a managed database, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail servers through the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface (CLI).</p> <p>For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all">Lightsail Dev Guide</a>.</p> <p>To use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to generate access keys. For details about how to set this up, see the <a href="http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli">Lightsail Dev Guide</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-lightsail-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`LightsailClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AllocateStaticIpCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  LightsailClient,
  AllocateStaticIpCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-lightsail-node");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  LightsailClient,
  AllocateStaticIpCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-lightsail-node";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const lightsail = new LightsailClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  staticIpName: /**a string value*/,
};
const allocateStaticIpCommand = new AllocateStaticIpCommand(params);
lightsail.send(allocateStaticIpCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await lightsail.send(allocateStaticIpCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
lightsail.send(allocateStaticIpCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-lightsail-node";
const lightsail = new AWS.Lightsail({ region: "region" });
lightsail.allocateStaticIp(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await lightsail.send(allocateStaticIpCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
