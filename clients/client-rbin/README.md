# @aws-sdk/client-rbin

## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript Rbin Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>This is the <i>Recycle Bin API Reference</i>. This documentation provides
descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>Recycle Bin is a resource recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally
deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are
deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify.</p>
<p>You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period
expires. After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the resource is removed from the
Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the same way you use any other resource of that type
in your account. If the retention period expires and the resource is not restored, the resource
is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for recovery. For more
information about Recycle Bin, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recycle-bin.html">
Recycle Bin</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-rbin
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-rbin`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-rbin`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-rbin`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `RbinClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ListRulesCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { RbinClient, ListRulesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-rbin");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { RbinClient, ListRulesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-rbin";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new RbinClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ListRulesCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-rbin";
const client = new AWS.Rbin({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.listRules(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .listRules(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.listRules(params, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
