/**
 * <p>Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies
 *             that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you
 *             enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can't use any
 *             of the advanced account administration features that Organizations supports. For more
 *             information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">Enabling all features in your organization</a> in the
 *                 <i>Organizations User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly
 *                 with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a
 *                 handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can
 *                 be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in
 *                 the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy
 *             types in a root using <a>EnablePolicyType</a> and <a>DisablePolicyType</a>. To see the status of policy types in a root, use
 *                 <a>ListRoots</a>.</p>
 *          <p>After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set
 *             change by accepting the handshake that contains <code>"Action":
 *                 "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"</code>. This completes the change.</p>
 *          <p>After you enable all features in your organization, the management account in the
 *             organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These policies can restrict what
 *             users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The management account can apply
 *             policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account
 *             administrators are aware of this.</p>
 *          <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.</p>
