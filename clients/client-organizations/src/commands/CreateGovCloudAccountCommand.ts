 *          <p>If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the

 *          <p>You call this action from the management account of your organization in the

 *             Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the

 *          <p>Calling <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services
 *             performs in the background. Because <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> operates
 *             asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account
 *             initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before
 *             you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of
 *             the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to
 *                     provide as a parameter to the <a>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</a>
 *                     operation.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Check the CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event. For
 *                     information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html">Logging and

 *          <p>When you call the <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> action, you create two accounts:
 *             a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the
 *             commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region
 *             is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both
 *             accounts are associated with the same email address.</p>
 *          <p>A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the
 *             management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services
 *             GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that
 *             you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can
 *             be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management
 *             account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that
