 * <p>Deletes the specified policy from your organization. Before you perform this

 *          <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's
 * management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an Amazon Web Services service.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { OrganizationsClient, DeletePolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-organizations"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { OrganizationsClient, DeletePolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-organizations"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new OrganizationsClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeletePolicyRequest
 *   PolicyId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeletePolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeletePolicyCommandInput - {@link DeletePolicyCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeletePolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeletePolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
