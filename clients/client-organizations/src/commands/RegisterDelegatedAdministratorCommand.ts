 *          <p>You can run this action only for Amazon Web Services services that support this

 *          </p>
 *          <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { OrganizationsClient, RegisterDelegatedAdministratorCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-organizations"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { OrganizationsClient, RegisterDelegatedAdministratorCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-organizations"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new OrganizationsClient(config);
 * const input = { // RegisterDelegatedAdministratorRequest

 *   ServicePrincipal: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new RegisterDelegatedAdministratorCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param RegisterDelegatedAdministratorCommandInput - {@link RegisterDelegatedAdministratorCommandInput}
