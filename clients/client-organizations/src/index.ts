 *             <b>Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services
 *                 SDK</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>For the current release of Organizations, specify the <code>us-east-1</code> region
 *             for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of
 *             China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify
 *                 <code>cn-northwest-1</code>. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters
 *             and commands:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and
 *                     its region:</p>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>
 *                   <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i>
 *                </p>
 *                <p>or</p>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>--endpoint-url
 *                         https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn</code>
 *                   <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i>
 *                </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this
 *                     command:</p>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code>
 *                   <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i>
 *                </p>
 *                <p>or</p>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1</code>
 *                   <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i>
 *                </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:</p>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>--region us-east-1</code>
 *                   <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)</i>
 *                </p>
 *                <p>or</p>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>--region cn-northwest-1</code>
 *                   <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i>
 *                </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Recording API Requests</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your
 *             Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected
 *             by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the
 *             request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see
 *                 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration">Logging
 *                 Organizations Events with CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>.
 *             To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the
 *                 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>
