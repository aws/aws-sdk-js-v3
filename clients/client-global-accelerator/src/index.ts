 *          <p>This is the <i>Global Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about
 * 		    Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the
 * 	    	<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>Global Accelerator is a service in which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance
 * 			of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can
 * 			gain additional benefits. </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications
 * 			    that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the Amazon Web Services
 * 				global network. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you
 * 				can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the
 * 		    	US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators.  That is, for example, specify <code>--region us-west-2</code>
 * 		    	on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses
 * 			are anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack,
 * 			Global Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses.
 * 			With a standard accelerator for IPv4, instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure
 * 			these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP). </p>
 *          <p>For a standard accelerator,
 * 	        they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions , which increases
 * 			the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers,
 * 	    	Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. For custom routing
 * 	        accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that
 * 			are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you
 * 				disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you
 * 					<i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that
 * 				are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use
 * 				IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have
 * 				permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based policies</a>.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based
 * 			on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to
 * 			changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always
 * 			directed to healthy endpoints.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>
