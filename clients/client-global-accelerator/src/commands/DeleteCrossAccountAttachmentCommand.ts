/**
 * @public
 * <p>Delete a cross-account attachment. When you delete an attachment, Global Accelerator revokes the permission
 * 			to use the resources in the attachment from all principals in the list of principals. Global Accelerator
 * 			revokes the permission for specific resources by doing the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the principal is an account ID, Global Accelerator reviews every accelerator in the account
 * 			and removes cross-account endpoints from all accelerators.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the principal is an accelerator, Global Accelerator reviews just that accelerator
 * 			and removes cross-account endpoints from it.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>If there are overlapping permissions provided by multiple cross-account attachments,
 * 		Global Accelerator only removes endpoints if there are no current cross-account attachments that provide
 * 		access permission. For example, if you delete a cross-account attachment that lists an
 * 		accelerator as a principal, but another cross-account attachment includes the account ID
 * 		that owns that accelerator, endpoints will not be removed from the accelerator.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GlobalAcceleratorClient, DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-global-accelerator"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GlobalAcceleratorClient, DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-global-accelerator"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GlobalAcceleratorClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentRequest
 *   AttachmentArn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommandInput - {@link DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteCrossAccountAttachmentCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GlobalAcceleratorClientResolvedConfig | config} for GlobalAcceleratorClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You don't have access permission.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link AttachmentNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>No cross-account attachment was found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServiceErrorException} (server fault)
 *  <p>There was an internal error for Global Accelerator.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidArgumentException} (client fault)
 *  <p>An argument that you specified is invalid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TransactionInProgressException} (client fault)
 *  <p>There's already a transaction in progress. Another transaction can't be processed.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link GlobalAcceleratorServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from GlobalAccelerator service.</p>
