/**
 * <p>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable,
 *         highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate,
 *         run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services Management Console or a few lines of code,
 *         you can create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or installing software. </p>
 *          <p>In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via open-source Cassandra drivers,
 *            Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, as well as
 *            infrastructure as code (IaC) services and tools such as CloudFormation and Terraform. This API reference describes
 *         the supported DDL operations in detail.</p>
 *          <p>For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cassandra-apis.html">Supported Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types
 *         in Amazon Keyspaces</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer
 *               Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail">Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer
 *             Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services APIs, for example how to implement retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon Web Services APIs</a> in the <i>General Reference</i>.</p>
