 * <fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname>
 *          <p></p>
 *          <p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and
 *           scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational
 *           database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications
 *           and businesses unique.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server,
 *           Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools
 *           you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS
 *           automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS
 *           is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your
 *           application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for
 *           the resources you use.</p>
 *          <p>This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface
 *           you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might
 *           require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this
 *           reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot,
 *           or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics
 *           from the user guide.</p>
