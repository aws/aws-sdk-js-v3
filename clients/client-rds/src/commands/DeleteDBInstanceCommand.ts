/**
 * @public
 * <p>The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance.
 *           When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered.
 *           Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to be deleted by <code>DeleteDBInstance</code> are not deleted.</p>
 *          <p>If you request a final DB snapshot
 *         the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance is <code>deleting</code> until the DB snapshot is created. The API action <code>DescribeDBInstance</code>
 *         is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted.</p>
 *          <p>When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of <code>failed</code>, <code>incompatible-restore</code>,
 *           or <code>incompatible-network</code>, you can only delete it when you skip creation of the final snapshot with the <code>SkipFinalSnapshot</code> parameter.</p>
 *          <p>If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you can't delete the DB instance if both of the following
 *       conditions are true:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB cluster.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>To delete a DB instance in this case, first call the
 *                 <code>PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster</code> API action to promote the DB cluster so
 *             it's no longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, then call the
 *                 <code>DeleteDBInstance</code> API action to delete the final instance in the DB
 *             cluster.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { RDSClient, DeleteDBInstanceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-rds"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { RDSClient, DeleteDBInstanceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-rds"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new RDSClient(config);
 * const input = {
 *   DBInstanceIdentifier: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   SkipFinalSnapshot: true || false,
 *   FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   DeleteAutomatedBackups: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDBInstanceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteDBInstanceCommandInput - {@link DeleteDBInstanceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteDBInstanceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteDBInstanceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteDBInstanceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link RDSClientResolvedConfig | config} for RDSClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link DBInstanceAutomatedBackupQuotaExceededFault} (client fault)
 *  <p>The quota for retained automated backups was exceeded. This prevents you
 *             from retaining any additional automated backups. The retained automated backups
 *             quota is the same as your DB Instance quota.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link DBInstanceNotFoundFault} (client fault)
 *  <p>
 *             <code>DBInstanceIdentifier</code> doesn't refer to an existing DB instance.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link DBSnapshotAlreadyExistsFault} (client fault)
 *  <p>
 *             <code>DBSnapshotIdentifier</code> is already used by an existing snapshot.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidDBClusterStateFault} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested operation can't be performed while the cluster is in this state.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidDBInstanceStateFault} (client fault)
 *  <p>The DB instance isn't in a valid state.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link SnapshotQuotaExceededFault} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request would result in the user exceeding the allowed number of DB
 *             snapshots.</p>
 *
 *
 * @example To delete a DB instance.
 * ```javascript
 * // This example deletes the specified DB instance.
 * const input = {
 *   "DBInstanceIdentifier": "mymysqlinstance",
 *   "SkipFinalSnapshot": true
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDBInstanceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * /* response ==
 * {
 *   "DBInstance": {}
 * }
 * *\/
 * // example id: delete-db-instance-4412e650-949c-488a-b32a-7d3038ebccc4
