 * <p> Deletes a dataset and associated artifacts. The operation will check to see if any
 *          inference scheduler or data ingestion job is currently using the dataset, and if there
 *          isn't, the dataset, its metadata, and any associated data stored in S3 will be deleted.
 *          This does not affect any models that used this dataset for training and evaluation, but
 *          does prevent it from being used in the future. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LookoutEquipmentClient, DeleteDatasetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lookoutequipment"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LookoutEquipmentClient, DeleteDatasetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lookoutequipment"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { LookoutEquipmentClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-lookoutequipment";
 * const config = {}; // type is LookoutEquipmentClientConfig
 * const client = new LookoutEquipmentClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteDatasetRequest
 *   DatasetName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDatasetCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
