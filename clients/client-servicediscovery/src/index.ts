 *          <p>With Cloud Map, you can configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP namespaces that your microservice
 *    applications run in. When an instance becomes available, you can call the Cloud Map API to register the
 *    instance with Cloud Map. For public or private DNS namespaces, Cloud Map automatically creates DNS records and
 *    an optional health check. Clients that submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP requests, for the service
 *    receive an answer that contains up to eight healthy records. </p>
