## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript ElasticLoadBalancingV2 Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>

<p>A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances.
This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also
monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to
healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one
or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for
connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check settings to be used
when checking the health status of the targets.</p>

<p>Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load
Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This
reference covers the following load balancer types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports
HTTP and HTTPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP,
TLS, and UDP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User
Guide</a>.</p>

<p>All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at
most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-elastic-load-balancing-v2
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-elastic-load-balancing-v2`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-elastic-load-balancing-v2`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-elastic-load-balancing-v2`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `ElasticLoadBalancingV2Client` and
the commands you need, for example `AddListenerCertificatesCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const {
  ElasticLoadBalancingV2Client,
  AddListenerCertificatesCommand,
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-elastic-load-balancing-v2");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import {
  ElasticLoadBalancingV2Client,
  AddListenerCertificatesCommand,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-elastic-load-balancing-v2";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new ElasticLoadBalancingV2Client({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new AddListenerCertificatesCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-elastic-load-balancing-v2";
const client = new AWS.ElasticLoadBalancingV2({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.addListenerCertificates(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .addListenerCertificates(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.addListenerCertificates(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
