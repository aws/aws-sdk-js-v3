/**
 * <p>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless, Prometheus-compatible monitoring service for
 *             container metrics that makes it easier to securely monitor container environments at
 *             scale. With Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, you can use the same open-source Prometheus data
 *             model and query language that you use today to monitor the performance of your
 *             containerized workloads, and also enjoy improved scalability, availability, and security
 *             without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/what-is-Amazon-Managed-Service-Prometheus.html">Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</a> User Guide.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus includes two APIs.</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the Amazon Web Services API described in this guide to manage Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus resources, such as workspaces, rule groups, and alert
 *                     managers.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-APIReference.html#AMP-APIReference-Prometheus-Compatible-Apis">Prometheus-compatible API</a> to work within your Prometheus
 *                     workspace.</p>
