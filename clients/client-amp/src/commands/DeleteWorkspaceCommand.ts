 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { AmpClient, DeleteWorkspaceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-amp"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { AmpClient, DeleteWorkspaceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-amp"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new AmpClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteWorkspaceRequest
 *   workspaceId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   clientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteWorkspaceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteWorkspaceCommandInput - {@link DeleteWorkspaceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteWorkspaceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteWorkspaceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteWorkspaceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link AmpClientResolvedConfig | config} for AmpClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient access to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request would cause an inconsistent state.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An unexpected error occurred during the processing of the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request references a resources that doesn't exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to request throttling.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
