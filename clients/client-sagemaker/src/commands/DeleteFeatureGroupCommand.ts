 * <p>Delete the <code>FeatureGroup</code> and any data that was written to the <code>OnlineStore</code> of the <code>FeatureGroup</code>. Data cannot be accessed from the <code>OnlineStore</code> immediately after <code>DeleteFeatureGroup</code> is called. </p> <p>Data written into the <code>OfflineStore</code> will not be deleted. The Amazon Web Services Glue database and tables that are automatically created for your <code>OfflineStore</code> are not deleted. </p> <p>Note that it can take approximately 10-15 minutes to delete an <code>OnlineStore</code> <code>FeatureGroup</code> with the <code>InMemory</code> <code>StorageType</code>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SageMakerClient, DeleteFeatureGroupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SageMakerClient, DeleteFeatureGroupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { SageMakerClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker";
 * const config = {}; // type is SageMakerClientConfig
 * const client = new SageMakerClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteFeatureGroupRequest
 *   FeatureGroupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteFeatureGroupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteFeatureGroupCommandInput - {@link DeleteFeatureGroupCommandInput}

 * @see {@link DeleteFeatureGroupCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SageMakerClientResolvedConfig | config} for SageMakerClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFound} (client fault)
 *  <p>Resource being access is not found.</p>
