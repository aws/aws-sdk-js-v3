 * <p>Delete the <code>FeatureGroup</code> and any data that was written to the
 *             <code>OnlineStore</code> of the <code>FeatureGroup</code>. Data cannot be accessed from
 *          the <code>OnlineStore</code> immediately after <code>DeleteFeatureGroup</code> is called. </p>
 *          <p>Data written into the <code>OfflineStore</code> will not be deleted. The Amazon Web Services Glue database and tables that are automatically created for your
 *             <code>OfflineStore</code> are not deleted. </p>
 *          <p>Note that it can take approximately 10-15 minutes to delete an <code>OnlineStore</code>
 *             <code>FeatureGroup</code> with the <code>InMemory</code>
 *             <code>StorageType</code>.</p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.

 * // const { SageMakerClient, DeleteFeatureGroupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SageMakerClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteFeatureGroupRequest

 * const command = new DeleteFeatureGroupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
