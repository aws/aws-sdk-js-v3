 * <p>Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console designed to help users
 *       mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their Amazon Web Services-hosted applications. An
 *       incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of services. </p>
 *          <p>Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact,
 *       highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration tools to get services
 *       back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of reducing the time-to-resolution of
 *       critical incidents, Incident Manager automates response plans and enables responder
 *       team escalation. </p>
