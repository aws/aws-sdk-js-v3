/**
 * <fullname>CodeBuild</fullname>
 *         <p>CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code,
 *             runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the
 *             need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged
 *             build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as
 *             Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild
 *             to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You
 *             pay only for the build time you consume. For more information about CodeBuild, see the <i>
 *                 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodeBuild User
 *                     Guide</a>.</i>
