/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified VPN connection.</p>
 *          <p>If you're deleting the VPC and its associated components, we recommend that you detach
 *             the virtual private gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before deleting the VPN
 *             connection. If you believe that the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have been
 *             compromised, you can delete the VPN connection and create a new one that has new keys,
 *             without needing to delete the VPC or virtual private gateway. If you create a new VPN
 *             connection, you must reconfigure the customer gateway device using the new configuration
 *             information returned with the new VPN connection ID.</p>
 *          <p>For certificate-based authentication, delete all Certificate Manager (ACM) private
 *             certificates used for the Amazon Web Services-side tunnel endpoints for the VPN
 *             connection before deleting the VPN connection.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, DeleteVpnConnectionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, DeleteVpnConnectionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteVpnConnectionRequest
 *   VpnConnectionId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   DryRun: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteVpnConnectionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteVpnConnectionCommandInput - {@link DeleteVpnConnectionCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteVpnConnectionCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteVpnConnectionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteVpnConnectionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link EC2ServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from EC2 service.</p>
