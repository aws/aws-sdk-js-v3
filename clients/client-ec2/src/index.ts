 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.
 *           Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications
 *           faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the
 *           Amazon Web Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store
 *           (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available
 *           and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and used like a hard drive.</p>
