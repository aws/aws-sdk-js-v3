/**
 * <p>The Identity Store service used by AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) provides a single place to retrieve all of
 *          your identities (users and groups). For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM Identity Center User
 *             Guide</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and
 *             <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for
 *             backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p>
 *          </note>
 *
 *          <p>This reference guide describes the identity store operations that you can call
 *          programatically and includes detailed information about data types and errors.</p>
