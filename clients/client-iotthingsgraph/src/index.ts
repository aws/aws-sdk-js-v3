 * <fullname>AWS IoT Things Graph</fullname>
 *          <p>AWS IoT Things Graph provides an integrated set of tools that enable developers to connect devices and services that use different standards,
 *        such as units of measure and communication protocols. AWS IoT Things Graph makes it possible to build IoT applications with little to no code by connecting devices and services
 *        and defining how they interact at an abstract level.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about how AWS IoT Things Graph works, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/thingsgraph/latest/ug/iot-tg-whatis.html">User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>The AWS IoT Things Graph service is discontinued.</p>
