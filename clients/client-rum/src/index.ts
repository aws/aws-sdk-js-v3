 * <p>With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to collect client-side data about
 *        your web application performance from actual user sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load
 *        times, client-side errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you can see it all aggregated together and
 *        also see breakdowns by the browsers and devices that your customers use.</p>
 *          <p>You can use the collected data to quickly identify and debug client-side performance issues. CloudWatch
 *        RUM helps you visualize anomalies in your application performance and find relevant debugging data such as error
 *        messages, stack traces, and user sessions. You can also use RUM to
 *        understand the range of end-user impact including the number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.</p>
