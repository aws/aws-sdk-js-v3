 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CodeCatalystClient, DeleteAccessTokenCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-codecatalyst"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CodeCatalystClient, DeleteAccessTokenCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-codecatalyst"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CodeCatalystClient(config);

 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because you don't have sufficient access to perform this action. Verify that you are a member of a role that allows this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because the requested operation would cause a conflict with the current state of a service resource associated with the request.
 *        Another user might have updated the resource. Reload, make sure you have the latest data, and then try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because the specified resource was not found. Verify that the spelling is correct and that you have access to the resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceQuotaExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because one or more resources has reached its limits for the tier the space belongs to. Either reduce
 *       the number of resources, or change the tier if applicable.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to request throttling.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
