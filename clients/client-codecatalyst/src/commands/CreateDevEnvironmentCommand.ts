/**
 * <p>Creates a Dev Environment in Amazon CodeCatalyst, a cloud-based development environment that you can use to quickly work on the code stored
 *       in the source repositories of your project.       </p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>When created in the Amazon CodeCatalyst console, by default a Dev Environment is configured to have a 2 core processor, 4GB of RAM, and 16GB of persistent storage. None of these
 *       defaults apply to a Dev Environment created programmatically.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CodeCatalystClient, CreateDevEnvironmentCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-codecatalyst"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CodeCatalystClient, CreateDevEnvironmentCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-codecatalyst"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CodeCatalystClient(config);
 * const input = { // CreateDevEnvironmentRequest
 *   spaceName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   projectName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   repositories: [ // RepositoriesInput
 *     { // RepositoryInput
 *       repositoryName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *       branchName: "STRING_VALUE",
 *     },
 *   ],
 *   clientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   alias: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ides: [ // IdeConfigurationList
 *     { // IdeConfiguration
 *       runtime: "STRING_VALUE",
 *       name: "STRING_VALUE",
 *     },
 *   ],
 *   instanceType: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   inactivityTimeoutMinutes: Number("int"),
 *   persistentStorage: { // PersistentStorageConfiguration
 *     sizeInGiB: Number("int"), // required
 *   },
 *   vpcConnectionName: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new CreateDevEnvironmentCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // CreateDevEnvironmentResponse
 * //   spaceName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //   projectName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //   id: "STRING_VALUE", // required
