/**
 * <p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can
 *             explore your resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of
 *             resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB
 *             tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and
 *             IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn
 *             the service on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.</p>
 *          <p>Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which
 *             you turn on Resource Explorer. Resource Explorer <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index">creates
 *                 and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that Region's
 *             resources.</p>
 *          <p>You can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">search across all of the
 *                 indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one of your Amazon Web Services Regions to
 *             contain the aggregator index for the account. When you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html">promote a local index
 *                 in a Region to become the aggregator index for the account</a>, Resource Explorer automatically
 *             replicates the index information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the
 *             aggregator index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all resource
 *             information for all Regions in the account where you turned on Resource Explorer. As a result,
 *             views in the aggregator index Region include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your
 *             account.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer, including how to enable and configure the
 *             service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/">Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide</a>.</p>
