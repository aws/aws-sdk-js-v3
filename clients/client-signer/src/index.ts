 * <p>AWS Signer is a fully managed code-signing service to help you ensure the trust and
 * 			integrity of your code. </p>
 * 		       <p>Signer supports the following applications:</p>
 * 		       <p>With code signing for AWS Lambda, you can sign <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/">AWS
 * 				Lambda</a> deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/">Amazon S3</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/">Amazon
 * 				CloudWatch</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">AWS CloudTrail</a>. In order
 * 			to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip
 * 			files in S3. </p>
 * 		       <p>With code signing for IoT, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS.
 * 			IoT code signing is available for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon FreeRTOS</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and is integrated with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you import a third-party code-signing
 * 			certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. </p>
 * 		       <p>With Signer and the Notation CLI from the <a href="https://notaryproject.dev/">Notary
 * 				Project</a>, you can sign container images stored in a container registry such
 * 			as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The signatures are stored in the registry
 * 			alongside the images, where they are available for verifying image authenticity and
 * 			integrity.</p>
 * 		       <p>For more information about Signer, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">AWS Signer Developer
 * 			Guide</a>.</p>
