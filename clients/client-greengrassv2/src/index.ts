/**
 * <p>IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities
 *       to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of
 *       information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on
 *       local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data
 *       to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components to create and
 *       deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.</p>
 *          <p>IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console.
 *       Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components,
 *       manage deployments, and core devices.</p>
 *          <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html">What is IoT Greengrass?</a> in the
 *         <i>IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide</i>.</p>
