/**
 * <p>Deletes a deployment. To delete an active deployment, you must first cancel it. For more
 *       information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CancelDeployment.html">CancelDeployment</a>.</p>
 *          <p>Deleting a deployment doesn't affect core devices that run that deployment, because core
 *       devices store the deployment's configuration on the device. Additionally, core devices can
 *       roll back to a previous deployment that has been deleted.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GreengrassV2Client, DeleteDeploymentCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-greengrassv2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GreengrassV2Client, DeleteDeploymentCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-greengrassv2"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { GreengrassV2ClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-greengrassv2";
 * const config = {}; // type is GreengrassV2ClientConfig
 * const client = new GreengrassV2Client(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteDeploymentRequest
 *   deploymentId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDeploymentCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteDeploymentCommandInput - {@link DeleteDeploymentCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteDeploymentCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteDeploymentCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteDeploymentCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GreengrassV2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for GreengrassV2Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You don't have permission to perform the action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Your request has conflicting operations. This can occur if you're trying to perform more
 *       than one operation on the same resource at the same time.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>IoT Greengrass can't process your request right now. Try again later.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested resource can't be found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Your request exceeded a request rate quota. For example, you might have exceeded the
 *       amount of times that you can retrieve device or deployment status per second.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request isn't valid. This can occur if your request contains malformed JSON or
 *       unsupported characters.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link GreengrassV2ServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from GreengrassV2 service.</p>
