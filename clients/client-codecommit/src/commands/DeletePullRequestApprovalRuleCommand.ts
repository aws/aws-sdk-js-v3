/**
 * <p>Deletes an approval rule from a specified pull request. Approval rules can be deleted from a pull request only if the pull request is open, and if the
 *             approval rule was created specifically for a pull request and not generated from an approval rule template associated with the repository where the
 *             pull request was created. You cannot delete an approval rule from a merged or closed pull request.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CodeCommitClient, DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-codecommit"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CodeCommitClient, DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-codecommit"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CodeCommitClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleInput
 *   pullRequestId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   approvalRuleName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleOutput
 * //   approvalRuleId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommandInput - {@link DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeletePullRequestApprovalRuleCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CodeCommitClientResolvedConfig | config} for CodeCommitClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ApprovalRuleNameRequiredException} (client fault)
 *  <p>An approval rule name is required, but was not specified.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link CannotDeleteApprovalRuleFromTemplateException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The approval rule cannot be deleted from the pull request because it was created by an
 *             approval rule template and applied to the pull request automatically.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link EncryptionIntegrityChecksFailedException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An encryption integrity check failed.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link EncryptionKeyAccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>An encryption key could not be accessed.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link EncryptionKeyDisabledException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The encryption key is disabled.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link EncryptionKeyNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>No encryption key was found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link EncryptionKeyUnavailableException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The encryption key is not available.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidApprovalRuleNameException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The name for the approval rule is not valid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidPullRequestIdException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The pull request ID is not valid. Make sure that you have provided the full ID and that the pull request is in the specified repository, and then try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PullRequestAlreadyClosedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The pull request status cannot be updated because it is already closed.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PullRequestDoesNotExistException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The pull request ID could not be found. Make sure that you have specified the correct repository name and pull request ID, and then try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PullRequestIdRequiredException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A pull request ID is required, but none was provided.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link CodeCommitServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from CodeCommit service.</p>
