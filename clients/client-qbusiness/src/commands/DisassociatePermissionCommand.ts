 * <p>Removes a permission policy from a Amazon Q Business application, revoking the cross-account access that was previously granted to an ISV. This operation deletes the specified policy statement from the application's permission policy.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { QBusinessClient, DisassociatePermissionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { QBusinessClient, DisassociatePermissionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new QBusinessClient(config);
 * const input = { // DisassociatePermissionRequest
 *   applicationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   statementId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DisassociatePermissionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```

 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You are trying to perform an action that conflicts with the current status of your resource. Fix any inconsistencies with your resources and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An issue occurred with the internal server used for your Amazon Q Business service. Wait some minutes and try again, or contact <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">Support</a> for help.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The application or plugin resource you want to use doesnâ€™t exist. Make sure you have provided the correct resource and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to throttling. Reduce the number of requests and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The input doesn't meet the constraints set by the Amazon Q Business service. Provide the correct input and try again.</p>
