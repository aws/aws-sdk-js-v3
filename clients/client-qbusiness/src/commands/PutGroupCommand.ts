/**
 * <p>Create, or updates, a mapping of users—who have access to a document—to
 *             groups.</p>
 *          <p>You can also map sub groups to groups. For example, the group "Company Intellectual
 *             Property Teams" includes sub groups "Research" and "Engineering". These sub groups
 *             include their own list of users or people who work in these teams. Only users who work
 *             in research and engineering, and therefore belong in the intellectual property group,
 *             can see top-secret company documents in their Amazon Q Business chat results.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { QBusinessClient, PutGroupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { QBusinessClient, PutGroupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new QBusinessClient(config);
 * const input = { // PutGroupRequest
 *   applicationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   indexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   groupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   dataSourceId: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   type: "INDEX" || "DATASOURCE", // required
 *   groupMembers: { // GroupMembers
 *     memberGroups: [ // MemberGroups
 *       { // MemberGroup
 *         groupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *         type: "INDEX" || "DATASOURCE",
 *       },
 *     ],
 *     memberUsers: [ // MemberUsers
 *       { // MemberUser
 *         userId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *         type: "INDEX" || "DATASOURCE",
 *       },
 *     ],
 *   },
 * };
 * const command = new PutGroupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```

 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You are trying to perform an action that conflicts with the current status of your
 *             resource. Fix any inconsistences with your resources and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An issue occurred with the internal server used for your Amazon Q Business service. Wait
 *             some minutes and try again, or contact <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">Support</a> for help.</p>
