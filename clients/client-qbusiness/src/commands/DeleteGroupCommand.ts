/**
 * <p>Deletes a group so that all users and sub groups that belong to the group can no
 *             longer access documents only available to that group. For example, after deleting the
 *             group "Summer Interns", all interns who belonged to that group no longer see intern-only
 *             documents in their chat results. </p>
 *          <p>If you want to delete, update, or replace users or sub groups of a group, you need to
 *             use the <code>PutGroup</code> operation. For example, if a user in the group
 *             "Engineering" leaves the engineering team and another user takes their place, you
 *             provide an updated list of users or sub groups that belong to the "Engineering" group
 *             when calling <code>PutGroup</code>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { QBusinessClient, DeleteGroupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { QBusinessClient, DeleteGroupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new QBusinessClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteGroupRequest
 *   applicationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   indexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   groupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   dataSourceId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteGroupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteGroupCommandInput - {@link DeleteGroupCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteGroupCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteGroupCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteGroupCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link QBusinessClientResolvedConfig | config} for QBusinessClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p> You don't have access to perform this action. Make sure you have the required
 *             permission policies and user accounts and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You are trying to perform an action that conflicts with the current status of your
 *             resource. Fix any inconsistences with your resources and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An issue occurred with the internal server used for your Amazon Q Business service. Wait
 *             some minutes and try again, or contact <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">Support</a> for help.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource you want to use doesnâ€™t exist. Make sure you have provided the correct
 *             resource and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to throttling. Reduce the number of requests and try
 *             again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The input doesn't meet the constraints set by the Amazon Q Business service. Provide the
 *             correct input and try again.</p>
 *
