/**
 * <p>Deletes a group so that all users and sub groups that belong to the group can no longer access documents only available to that group. For example, after deleting the group "Summer Interns", all interns who belonged to that group no longer see intern-only documents in their chat results. </p> <p>If you want to delete, update, or replace users or sub groups of a group, you need to use the <code>PutGroup</code> operation. For example, if a user in the group "Engineering" leaves the engineering team and another user takes their place, you provide an updated list of users or sub groups that belong to the "Engineering" group when calling <code>PutGroup</code>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { QBusinessClient, DeleteGroupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { QBusinessClient, DeleteGroupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { QBusinessClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness";
 * const config = {}; // type is QBusinessClientConfig
 * const client = new QBusinessClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteGroupRequest
 *   applicationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   indexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   groupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   dataSourceId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteGroupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteGroupCommandInput - {@link DeleteGroupCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteGroupCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteGroupCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteGroupCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
