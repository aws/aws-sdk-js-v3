 * <p>Deletes an Amazon Q Business data source connector. While the data source is being

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { QBusinessClient, DeleteDataSourceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { QBusinessClient, DeleteDataSourceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-qbusiness"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new QBusinessClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteDataSourceRequest
 *   applicationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   indexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   dataSourceId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDataSourceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteDataSourceCommandInput - {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteDataSourceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link QBusinessClientResolvedConfig | config} for QBusinessClient's `config` shape.

 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You are trying to perform an action that conflicts with the current status of your
 *             resource. Fix any inconsistences with your resources and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An issue occurred with the internal server used for your Amazon Q Business service. Wait
 *             some minutes and try again, or contact <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">Support</a> for help.</p>

 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource you want to use doesnâ€™t exist. Make sure you have provided the correct

 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to throttling. Reduce the number of requests and try
 *             again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
