 * <p>Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects event sources to targets. Pipes reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing
 *       event driven architectures. This helps ensures consistency across your company’s applications. With Pipes, the target can be any available EventBridge target.
 *       To set up a pipe, you select the event source, add optional event filtering, define optional enrichment, and select the target for the event data. </p>
