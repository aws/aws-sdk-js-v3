 * <p>Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects event sources to targets. Pipes reduces the need
 *          for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event driven architectures.
 *          This helps ensures consistency across your companyâ€™s applications. With Pipes, the target
 *          can be any available EventBridge target. To set up a pipe, you select the event
 *          source, add optional event filtering, define optional enrichment, and select the target for
 *          the event data. </p>
