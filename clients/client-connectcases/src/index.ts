 *          <p>With Amazon Connect Cases, your agents can track and manage customer issues that require
 *       multiple interactions, follow-up tasks, and teams in your contact center. A case represents a
 *       customer issue. It records the issue, the steps and interactions taken to resolve the issue,
 *       and the outcome. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/cases.html">Amazon Connect Cases</a> in the
