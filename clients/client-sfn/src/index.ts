 * <fullname>Step Functions</fullname>
 *          <p>Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications
 *       and microservices using visual workflows.</p>
 *          <p>You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs
 *       a discrete function, or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change
 *       applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps visualize the components of your
 *       application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and
 *       retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right
 *       order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any
 *       issues.</p>
 *          <p>Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is
 *       available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own servers, or any system that has
 *       access to Amazon Web Services. You can access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or an HTTP API.
 *       For more information about Step Functions, see the <i>
 *                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html">Step Functions Developer Guide</a>
