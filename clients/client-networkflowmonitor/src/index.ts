/**
 * <p>Network Flow Monitor is a feature of Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitoring that provides visibility into the performance of
 * 	  		network flows for your Amazon Web Services workloads, between instances in subnets, as well as to and
 * 	  		from Amazon Web Services. Lightweight agents that you install on the instances capture performance metrics
 * 	  		for your network flows, such as packet loss and latency, and send them to the Network Flow Monitor backend. Then, you can
 * 	  		view and analyze metrics from the top contributors for each metric type, to help troubleshoot issues.</p>
 *          <p>In addition, when you create a monitor, Network Flow Monitor provides a network health indicator (NHI)
 * 	  		that informs you whether there were Amazon Web Services network issues for one or more of the network flows
 * 	  		tracked by a monitor, during a time period that you choose. By using this value, you can independently determine
 * 	  		if the Amazon Web Services network is impacting your workload during a specific time frame, to help you focus
 * 	  		troubleshooting efforts.</p>
 *          <p>To learn more about Network Flow Monitor, see the
 * 	  		<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-NetworkFlowMonitor.html">Network Flow Monitor User Guide</a>
 * 				in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.</p>
