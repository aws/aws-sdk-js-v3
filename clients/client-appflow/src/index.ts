 * <p>Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for developers who need
 *       detailed information about the Amazon AppFlow API operations, data types, and errors. </p>
 *          <p>Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely
 *       transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo,
 *       Slack, and ServiceNow, and Amazon Web Services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift. </p>
 *          <p>Use the following links to get started on the Amazon AppFlow API:</p>

 *          <p>Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and include
 *       applicable OAuth attributes (such as <code>auth-code</code> and <code>redirecturi</code>) with
 *       the connector-specific <code>ConnectorProfileProperties</code> when creating a new connector
 *       profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations. For example, Salesforce users can refer to
 *       the <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm">
 *                <i>Authorize Apps with OAuth</i>
 *             </a> documentation.</p>
