 * <p>Welcome to the <i>AWS Clean Rooms API Reference</i>.</p>
 *          <p>AWS Clean Rooms is an AWS service that helps multiple parties to join their data
 *          together in a secure collaboration workspace. In the collaboration, members who can query
 *          and receive results can get insights into the collective datasets without either party getting
 *          access to the other party's raw data.</p>
 *          <p>To learn more about AWS Clean Rooms concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/what-is.html">AWS Clean
