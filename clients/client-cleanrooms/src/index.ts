 * <p>Welcome to the <i>Clean Rooms API Reference</i>.</p>
 *          <p>Clean Rooms is an Amazon Web Services service that helps multiple parties to join
 *          their data together in a secure collaboration workspace. In the collaboration, members who
 *          can query and receive results can get insights into the collective datasets without either
 *          party getting access to the other party's raw data.</p>
 *          <p>To learn more about Clean Rooms concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/what-is.html">Clean Rooms User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>To learn more about SQL commands, functions, and conditions supported in Clean Rooms, see the
