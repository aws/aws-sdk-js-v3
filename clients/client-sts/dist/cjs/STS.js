/**
 * <fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname>
 *          <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request
 *       temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or
 *       for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS
 *       API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a>. </p>
 *
 *
 *          <p>For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to
 *         <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing
 *         AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general
 *       information about the Query API, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making Query Requests</a> in
 *         <i>Using IAM</i>. For information about using security tokens with other AWS
 *       products, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">AWS Services That
 *         Work with IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p>
 *          <p>If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific AWS
 *       product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/</a>. </p>

 *          <p>
 *             <b>Endpoints</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all AWS
 *       STS requests go to a single endpoint at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Global
 *       requests map to the US East (N. Virginia) region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS
 *       endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase
 *       session token validity. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Managing AWS STS in an
 *         AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>Most AWS Regions are enabled for operations in all AWS services by default. Those Regions
 *       are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. Some Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong
 *       Kong), must be manually enabled. To learn more about enabling and disabling AWS Regions, see
 *         <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS
 *         Regions</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. When you enable these AWS
 *       Regions, they are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. You cannot activate the STS
 *       endpoint for a Region that is disabled. Tokens that are valid in all AWS Regions are longer
 *       than tokens that are valid in Regions that are enabled by default. Changing this setting might
 *       affect existing systems where you temporarily store tokens. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-manage-tokens">Managing Global Endpoint Session Tokens</a> in the <i>IAM User
 *       Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>After you activate a Region for use with AWS STS, you can direct AWS STS API calls to that
 *       Region. AWS STS recommends that you provide both the Region and endpoint when you make calls
 *       to a Regional endpoint. You can provide the Region alone for manually enabled Regions, such as
 *       Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). In this case, the calls are directed to the STS Regional endpoint.
 *       However, if you provide the Region alone for Regions enabled by default, the calls are
 *       directed to the global endpoint of <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>.</p>
 *          <p>To view the list of AWS STS endpoints and whether they are active by default, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#id_credentials_temp_enable-regions_writing_code">Writing Code to Use AWS STS Regions</a> in the <i>IAM User
 *       Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Recording API requests</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your AWS
 *       account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by
 *       CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made to STS, who made the
 *       request, when it was made, and so on.</p>
 *          <p>If you activate AWS STS endpoints in Regions other than the default global endpoint, then
 *       you must also turn on CloudTrail logging in those Regions. This is necessary to record any AWS
 *       STS API calls that are made in those Regions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_turn_on_ct.html">Turning On
 *         CloudTrail in Additional Regions</a> in the <i>AWS CloudTrail User
 *         Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a global service with a single endpoint at
 *         <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Calls to this endpoint are logged as calls to a
 *       global service. However, because this endpoint is physically located in the US East (N.
 *       Virginia) Region, your logs list <code>us-east-1</code> as the event Region. CloudTrail does
 *       not write these logs to the US East (Ohio) Region unless you choose to include global service
 *       logs in that Region. CloudTrail writes calls to all Regional endpoints to their respective
 *       Regions. For example, calls to sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com are published to the US East (Ohio)
 *       Region and calls to sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com are published to the EU (Frankfurt)
 *       Region.</p>
 *          <p>To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see
 *       the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail User
 *         Guide</a>.</p>
