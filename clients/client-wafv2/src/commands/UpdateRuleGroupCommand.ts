/**
 * <p>Updates the specified <a>RuleGroup</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that you already have for the rule group with the ones that you provide to this call. </p>
 *             <p>To modify a rule group, do the following: </p>
 *             <ol>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Retrieve it by calling <a>GetRuleGroup</a>
 *                   </p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Update its settings as needed</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Provide the complete rule group specification to this call</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ol>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>When you make changes to web ACLs or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.</p>
 *          <p> A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a <a>WebACL</a>. When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { WAFV2Client, UpdateRuleGroupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-wafv2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { WAFV2Client, UpdateRuleGroupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-wafv2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new WAFV2Client(config);
 * const command = new UpdateRuleGroupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link UpdateRuleGroupCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link UpdateRuleGroupCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link WAFV2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for WAFV2Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFConfigurationWarningException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because you are inspecting the web request body, headers, or
 *          cookies without specifying how to handle oversize components. Rules that inspect the body
 *          must either provide an <code>OversizeHandling</code> configuration or they must be preceded
 *          by a <code>SizeConstraintStatement</code> that blocks the body content from being too
 *          large. Rules that inspect the headers or cookies must provide an
 *             <code>OversizeHandling</code> configuration. </p>
 *          <p>Provide the handling configuration and retry your operation.</p>
 *          <p>Alternately, you can suppress this warning by adding the following tag to the resource
 *          that you provide to this operation: <code>Tag</code>
 *             (key:<code>WAF:OversizeFieldsHandlingConstraintOptOut</code>,
 *          value:<code>true</code>).</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFDuplicateItemException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t perform the operation because the resource that you tried to save is
 *          a duplicate of an existing one.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFInternalErrorException} (server fault)
 *  <p>Your request is valid, but WAF couldn’t perform the operation because of a system
 *          problem. Retry your request. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFInvalidOperationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation isn't valid. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFInvalidParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because WAF didn't recognize a parameter in the request. For
 *          example: </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You specified a parameter name or value that isn't valid.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Your nested statement isn't valid. You might have tried to nest a statement that
 *                can’t be nested. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You tried to update a <code>WebACL</code> with a <code>DefaultAction</code> that
 *                isn't among the types available at <a>DefaultAction</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Your request references an ARN that is malformed, or corresponds to a resource
 *                with which a web ACL can't be associated.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFLimitsExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t perform the operation because you exceeded your resource limit. For
 *          example, the maximum number of <code>WebACL</code> objects that you can create for an Amazon Web Services
 *          account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html">WAF quotas</a> in the
 *             <i>WAF Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFNonexistentItemException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t perform the operation because your resource doesn't exist.
 *        If you've just created a resource that you're using in this operation, you might
 *        just need to wait a few minutes. It can take from a few seconds to a number of minutes
 *        for changes to propagate. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFOptimisticLockException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t save your changes because you tried to update or delete a resource
 *          that has changed since you last retrieved it. Get the resource again, make any changes you
 *          need to make to the new copy, and retry your operation. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFSubscriptionNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You tried to use a managed rule group that's available by subscription, but you aren't
 *          subscribed to it yet. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFUnavailableEntityException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t retrieve a resource that you specified for this operation.
 *        If you've just created a resource that you're using in this operation, you might
 *        just need to wait a few minutes. It can take from a few seconds to a number of minutes
 *        for changes to propagate. Verify the resources that you are specifying in your request
 *        parameters and then retry the operation.</p>
