/**
 * @public
 * <p>Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules.
 *          You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a
 *          <a>RuleGroup</a> or <a>WebACL</a>.
 *          </p>
 *          <p>WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating
 *          resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF
 *          calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule.
 *          Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules
 * 				that use more processing power.
 * 				Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their
 *          web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group.
 *          The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.  </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { WAFV2Client, CheckCapacityCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-wafv2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { WAFV2Client, CheckCapacityCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-wafv2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new WAFV2Client(config);
 * const command = new CheckCapacityCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @param CheckCapacityCommandInput - {@link CheckCapacityCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link CheckCapacityCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link CheckCapacityCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CheckCapacityCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link WAFV2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for WAFV2Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFExpiredManagedRuleGroupVersionException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because the specified version for the managed rule group has
 *          expired. You can retrieve the available versions for the managed rule group by calling
 *             <a>ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions</a>.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFInternalErrorException} (server fault)
 *  <p>Your request is valid, but WAF couldn’t perform the operation because of a system
 *          problem. Retry your request. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFInvalidOperationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation isn't valid. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFInvalidParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because WAF didn't recognize a parameter in the request. For
 *          example: </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You specified a parameter name or value that isn't valid.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Your nested statement isn't valid. You might have tried to nest a statement that
 *                can’t be nested. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You tried to update a <code>WebACL</code> with a <code>DefaultAction</code> that
 *                isn't among the types available at <a>DefaultAction</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Your request references an ARN that is malformed, or corresponds to a resource
 *                with which a web ACL can't be associated.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFInvalidResourceException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t perform the operation because the resource that you requested isn’t
 *          valid. Check the resource, and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFLimitsExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t perform the operation because you exceeded your resource limit. For
 *          example, the maximum number of <code>WebACL</code> objects that you can create for an Amazon Web Services
 *          account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html">WAF quotas</a> in the
 *             <i>WAF Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFNonexistentItemException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t perform the operation because your resource doesn't exist.
 *        If you've just created a resource that you're using in this operation, you might
 *        just need to wait a few minutes. It can take from a few seconds to a number of minutes
 *        for changes to propagate. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFSubscriptionNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You tried to use a managed rule group that's available by subscription, but you aren't
 *          subscribed to it yet. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WAFUnavailableEntityException} (client fault)
 *  <p>WAF couldn’t retrieve a resource that you specified for this operation.
 *        If you've just created a resource that you're using in this operation, you might
 *        just need to wait a few minutes. It can take from a few seconds to a number of minutes
 *        for changes to propagate. Verify the resources that you are specifying in your request
 *        parameters and then retry the operation.</p>
