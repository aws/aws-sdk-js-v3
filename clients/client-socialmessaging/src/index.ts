 *          </p>
 *          <p>The <i>Amazon Web Services End User Messaging Social API</i> is available across several Amazon Web Services Regions and it provides a dedicated endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of
 *          all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">Amazon Web Services Service Endpoints</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/end-user-messaging.html">Amazon Web Services End User Messaging endpoints and quotas</a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To learn more about Amazon Web Services Regions, see
 *             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing
 *                Amazon Web Services Regions</a> in the Amazon Web Services General
 *          Reference.</p>
 *          <p>In each Region, Amazon Web Services maintains multiple Availability Zones. These
 *          Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
 *          low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability
 *          Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also
 *          minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available
 *          in each Region, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">Amazon Web Services Global Infrastructure.</a>
