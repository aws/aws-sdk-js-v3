/**
 * <p>Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management service from Amazon Web Services. You can use Verified Permissions to manage
 *             permissions for your application, and authorize user access based on those permissions.
 *             Using Verified Permissions, application developers can grant access based on information about the
 *             users, resources, and requested actions. You can also evaluate additional information
 *             like group membership, attributes of the resources, and session context, such as time of
 *             request and IP addresses. Verified Permissions manages these permissions by letting you create and
 *             store authorization policies for your applications, such as consumer-facing web sites
 *             and enterprise business systems.</p>
 *          <p>Verified Permissions uses Cedar as the policy language to express your permission requirements.
 *             Cedar supports both role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access
 *             control (ABAC) authorization models.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about configuring, administering, and using Amazon Verified Permissions in your
 *             applications, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/">Amazon Verified Permissions User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about the Cedar policy language, see the <a href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/">Cedar Policy Language Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>When you write Cedar policies that reference principals, resources and actions,
 *                 you can define the unique identifiers used for each of those elements. We strongly
 *                 recommend that you follow these best practices:</p>
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <b>Use values like universally unique identifiers
 *                             (UUIDs) for all principal and resource identifiers.</b>
 *                   </p>
 *                   <p>For example, if user <code>jane</code> leaves the company, and you later
 *                         let someone else use the name <code>jane</code>, then that new user
 *                         automatically gets access to everything granted by policies that still
 *                         reference <code>User::"jane"</code>. Cedar can’t distinguish between the
 *                         new user and the old. This applies to both principal and resource
 *                         identifiers. Always use identifiers that are guaranteed unique and never
 *                         reused to ensure that you don’t unintentionally grant access because of the
 *                         presence of an old identifier in a policy.</p>
 *                   <p>Where you use a UUID for an entity, we recommend that you follow it with
 *                         the // comment specifier and the ‘friendly’ name of your entity. This helps
 *                         to make your policies easier to understand. For example: principal ==
 *                         User::"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a1b2-c3d4-EXAMPLE11111", // alice</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>
 *                      <b>Do not include personally identifying, confidential,
 *                             or sensitive information as part of the unique identifier for your
 *                             principals or resources.</b> These identifiers are included in
 *                         log entries shared in CloudTrail trails.</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ul>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>Several operations return structures that appear similar, but have different purposes.
 *             As new functionality is added to the product, the structure used in a parameter of one
 *             operation might need to change in a way that wouldn't make sense for the same parameter
 *             in a different operation. To help you understand the purpose of each, the following
 *             naming convention is used for the structures:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Parameter type structures that end in <code>Detail</code> are used in
 *                         <code>Get</code> operations.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Parameter type structures that end in <code>Item</code> are used in
 *                         <code>List</code> operations.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Parameter type structures that use neither suffix are used in the mutating
 *                     (create and update) operations.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
