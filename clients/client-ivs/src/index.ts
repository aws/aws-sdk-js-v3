 *             <b>Introduction</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP
 *       API and an Amazon Web Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both
 *       requests and responses, including errors.</p>
 *          <p>The API is an Amazon Web Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and
 *       Amazon IVS HTTPS service endpoints, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS page</a> in the
 *           <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <i>
 *                <b>All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive.
 *         </b>
 *             </i>
 *          </p>

 *             <b>Key Concepts</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Channel</b> — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Stream key</b> — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. <i>
 *                      <b>Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.</b>
 *                   </i>
 *                </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Playback key pair</b> — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Recording configuration</b> — Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <b>Playback restriction policy</b> — Restricts playback by countries and/or origin sites.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>For more information about your IVS live stream, also see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/getting-started.html">Getting Started with IVS Low-Latency Streaming</a>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Tagging</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>A <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services
 *       resource. A tag comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both
 *       set by you. For example, you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a
 *       particular video category. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html">Best practices and strategies</a> in <i>Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor</i> for details, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented
 *       there.</p>
 *          <p>Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. For example,
 *       you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can
 *       also use tags to manage access (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html"> Access Tags</a>). </p>
 *          <p>The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related operations: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following
 *       resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording
 *       Configurations.</p>
 *          <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource. </p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Authentication versus Authorization</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Note the differences between these concepts:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. You need to be
 *           authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition,
 *           authorization is needed to view <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html">Amazon IVS private channels</a>.
 *           (Private channels are channels that are enabled for "playback authorization.")</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Authentication</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The Amazon Web Services
 *       Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying
 *       API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your
 *       responsibility to sign the requests.</p>
 *          <p>You generate a signature using valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission
 *       to perform the requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a
 *       signature generated from a user account that has the <code>ivs:PutMetadata</code>
 *       permission.</p>
 *          <p>For more information:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Authentication and generating signatures — See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests
 *               (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services
 *             General Reference</i>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity and Access Management</a> on
 *           the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User Guide</i>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need to specify a
 *       resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies and API
 *       calls. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
 *         Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p>
