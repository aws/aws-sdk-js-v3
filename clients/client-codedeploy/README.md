## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript CodeDeploy Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>AWS CodeDeploy</fullname>

<p>AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to
Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility, serverless
AWS Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service.</p>
<p>You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated
Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration
files, executables, packages, scripts,
multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in
Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to
make changes to your existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy.</p>
<p>AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you
avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating
your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual
deployments.</p>
<p>
<b>AWS CodeDeploy Components</b>
</p>
<p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following AWS CodeDeploy
components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Application</b>: A name that uniquely identifies
the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this name, which
functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision,
deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a
deployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Deployment group</b>: A set of individual
instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS
service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route
traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group
specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a
listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application.
An EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances,
Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment
groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Deployment configuration</b>: A set of deployment
rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy
during a deployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Deployment</b>: The process and the components used
when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS
service, or of installing content on one or more instances. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Application revisions</b>: For an AWS Lambda
deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be
updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For
an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS
task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For
an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source
content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along
with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub
repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3
object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely
identified by its commit ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in
your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy
deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about
Amazon ECS service deployments.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-codedeploy
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-codedeploy`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-codedeploy`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-codedeploy`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `CodeDeployClient` and
the commands you need, for example `AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { CodeDeployClient, AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { CodeDeployClient, AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new CodeDeployClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new AddTagsToOnPremisesInstancesCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy";
const client = new AWS.CodeDeploy({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.addTagsToOnPremisesInstances(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .addTagsToOnPremisesInstances(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.addTagsToOnPremisesInstances(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
