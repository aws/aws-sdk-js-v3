 * <p>Amazon Web Services AppFabric quickly connects software as a service (SaaS) applications across your
 *          organization. This allows IT and security teams to easily manage and secure applications
 *          using a standard schema, and employees can complete everyday tasks faster using generative
 *          artificial intelligence (AI). You can use these APIs to complete AppFabric tasks, such as
 *          setting up audit log ingestions or viewing user access. For more information about AppFabric,
 *          including the required permissions to use the service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/latest/adminguide/">Amazon Web Services AppFabric Administration Guide</a>. For more
 *          information about using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage your
 *          AppFabric resources, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/appfabric/index.html">AppFabric section of the CLI
 *             Reference</a>.</p>
