 * <p>Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more
 * 			than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't
 * 			delete two composite alarms with one operation.</p>
 *          <p>
 * 			If you specify an incorrect alarm name or make any other error in the operation, no alarms are
 * 			deleted. To confirm that alarms were deleted successfully, you can use
 * 			the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarms.html">DescribeAlarms</a> operation after using
 * 		<code>DeleteAlarms</code>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and
 * 			composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle
 * 			because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.</p>
 *             <p>To get out of such a situation, you must
 * 				break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest
 * 				change to make to break a cycle is to change the <code>AlarmRule</code> of one of the alarms to <code>false</code>. </p>
 *             <p>Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
 * 			</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudWatchClient, DeleteAlarmsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudWatchClient, DeleteAlarmsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudWatchClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteAlarmsInput
 *   AlarmNames: [ // AlarmNames // required
 *     "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ],
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteAlarmsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteAlarmsCommandInput - {@link DeleteAlarmsCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteAlarmsCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteAlarmsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteAlarmsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudWatchClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudWatchClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFound} (client fault)
 *  <p>The named resource does not exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link CloudWatchServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from CloudWatch service.</p>
