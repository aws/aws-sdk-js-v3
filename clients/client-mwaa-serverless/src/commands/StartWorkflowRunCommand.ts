/**
 * <p>Starts a new execution of a workflow. This operation creates a workflow run that executes the tasks that are defined in the workflow. Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Serverless schedules the workflow execution across its managed Airflow environment, automatically scaling ECS worker tasks based on the workload. The service handles task isolation, dependency resolution, and provides comprehensive monitoring and logging throughout the execution lifecycle.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { MWAAServerlessClient, StartWorkflowRunCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-mwaa-serverless"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { MWAAServerlessClient, StartWorkflowRunCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-mwaa-serverless"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { MWAAServerlessClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-mwaa-serverless";
 * const config = {}; // type is MWAAServerlessClientConfig
 * const client = new MWAAServerlessClient(config);
 * const input = { // StartWorkflowRunRequest
 *   WorkflowArn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ClientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   OverrideParameters: { // ObjectMap
 *     "<keys>": "DOCUMENT_VALUE",
 *   },
 *   WorkflowVersion: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new StartWorkflowRunCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // StartWorkflowRunResponse
 * //   RunId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   Status: "STARTING" || "QUEUED" || "RUNNING" || "SUCCESS" || "FAILED" || "TIMEOUT" || "STOPPING" || "STOPPED",
 * //   StartedAt: new Date("TIMESTAMP"),
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param StartWorkflowRunCommandInput - {@link StartWorkflowRunCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link StartWorkflowRunCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link StartWorkflowRunCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link StartWorkflowRunCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link MWAAServerlessClientResolvedConfig | config} for MWAAServerlessClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient permission to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You cannot create a resource that already exists, or the resource is in a state that prevents the requested operation.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An unexpected server-side error occurred during request processing.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OperationTimeoutException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The operation timed out.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified resource was not found. You can only access or modify a resource that already exists.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceQuotaExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request exceeds the service quota for Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Serverless resources. This can occur when you attempt to create more workflows than allowed, exceed concurrent workflow run limits, or surpass task execution limits. Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Serverless implements admission control using DynamoDB-based counters to manage resource utilization across the multi-tenant environment. Contact Amazon Web Services Support to request quota increases if you need higher limits for your use case.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because too many requests were made in a short period, exceeding the service rate limits. Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Serverless implements throttling controls to ensure fair resource allocation across all customers in the multi-tenant environment. This helps maintain service stability and performance. If you encounter throttling, implement exponential backoff and retry logic in your applications, or consider distributing your API calls over a longer time period.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified request parameters are invalid, missing, or inconsistent with Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Serverless service requirements. This can occur when workflow definitions contain unsupported operators, when required IAM permissions are missing, when S3 locations are inaccessible, or when network configurations are invalid. The service validates workflow definitions, execution roles, and resource configurations to ensure compatibility with the managed Airflow environment and security requirements.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link MWAAServerlessServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from MWAAServerless service.</p>
