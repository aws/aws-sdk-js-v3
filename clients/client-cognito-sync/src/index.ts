 * <fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname>
 *       <p>Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of
 *          application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and
 *          Android. You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if
 *          the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device
 *          to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
 *          credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value
 *          pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.</p>
 *       <p>With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to
 *          credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need
 *          to make API calls using credentials retrieved with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Cognito Identity service</a>.</p>
 *       <p>If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will probably want to
 *          make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for Android</a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for iOS</a>.</p>
