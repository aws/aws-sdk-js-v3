## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript CognitoSync Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname>

<p>Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.</p>
<p>With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to
credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need
to make API calls using credentials retrieved with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Cognito Identity service</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will probably want to
make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for Android</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for iOS</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-cognito-sync
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-cognito-sync`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-cognito-sync`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-cognito-sync`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `CognitoSyncClient` and
the commands you need, for example `BulkPublishCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { CognitoSyncClient, BulkPublishCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cognito-sync");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { CognitoSyncClient, BulkPublishCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cognito-sync";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new CognitoSyncClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new BulkPublishCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-cognito-sync";
const client = new AWS.CognitoSync({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.bulkPublish(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .bulkPublish(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.bulkPublish(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
