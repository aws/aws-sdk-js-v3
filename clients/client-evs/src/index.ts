 * <p>Amazon Elastic VMware Service (Amazon EVS) is a service that you can use to deploy a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) software environment directly on EC2 bare metal instances within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).</p> <p>Workloads running on Amazon EVS are fully compatible with workloads running on any standard VMware vSphere environment. This means that you can migrate any VMware-based workload to Amazon EVS without workload modification.</p>
