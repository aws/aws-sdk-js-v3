## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript StorageGateway Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>AWS Storage Gateway Service</fullname>

<p>AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance with
cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an
organization's on-premises IT environment and the AWS storage infrastructure. The
service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS Cloud for cost effective backup and
rapid disaster recovery.</p>

</ul>

<note>
<p>AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs
with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your
resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the
ID for a volume might be <code>vol-AA22BB012345DAF670</code>. When you use this ID with
the EC2 API, you must change it to <code>vol-aa22bb012345daf670</code>. Otherwise, the
EC2 API might not behave as expected.</p>
</note>

<important>
<p>IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes
are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and
snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will
be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For
more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2 and
EBS resource IDs</a>.</p>

<p>For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format
looks like the following:</p>

<p>
<code>arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG</code>.</p>

<p>A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following:
<code>snap-78e226633445566ee</code>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-storage-gateway
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-storage-gateway`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-storage-gateway`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-storage-gateway`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `StorageGatewayClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ActivateGatewayCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { StorageGatewayClient, ActivateGatewayCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-storage-gateway");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { StorageGatewayClient, ActivateGatewayCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-storage-gateway";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new StorageGatewayClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ActivateGatewayCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-storage-gateway";
const client = new AWS.StorageGateway({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.activateGateway(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .activateGateway(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.activateGateway(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
