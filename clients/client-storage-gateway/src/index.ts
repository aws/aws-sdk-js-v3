 * <fullname>Storage Gateway Service</fullname>
 *          <p>Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance
 *          with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an
 *          organization's on-premises IT environment and the Amazon Web Services storage
 *          infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.</p>
 *          <p>Use the following links to get started using the <i>Storage Gateway
 *             Service API Reference</i>:</p>

 *          </ul>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs
 *             with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change
 *             your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage
 *             Gateway the ID for a volume might be <code>vol-AA22BB012345DAF670</code>. When you use
 *             this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to <code>vol-aa22bb012345daf670</code>.
 *             Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway
 *             volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and
 *             snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will
 *             be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For
 *             more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2 and
 *                EBS resource IDs</a>.</p>
 *             <p>For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format
 *             looks like the following:</p>
 *             <p>
 *                <code>arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG</code>.</p>
 *             <p>A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following:
 *                <code>snap-78e226633445566ee</code>.</p>
 *             <p>For more information, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=3557">Announcement:
 *                Heads-up â€“ Longer Storage Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in
