/**
 * <p>Refreshes the cached inventory of objects for the specified file share. This operation
 *          finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that were added, removed, or replaced since
 *          the gateway last listed the bucket's contents and cached the results. This operation
 *          does not import files into the S3 File Gateway cache storage. It only updates the cached
 *          inventory to reflect changes in the inventory of the objects in the S3 bucket. This
 *          operation is only supported in the S3 File Gateway types.</p>
 *          <p>You can subscribe to be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event when your
 *             <code>RefreshCache</code> operation completes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification">Getting
 *             notified about file operations</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 File Gateway User
 *             Guide</i>. This operation is Only supported for S3 File Gateways.</p>
 *          <p>When this API is called, it only initiates the refresh operation. When the API call
 *          completes and returns a success code, it doesn't necessarily mean that the file
 *          refresh has completed. You should use the refresh-complete notification to determine that
 *          the operation has completed before you check for new files on the gateway file share. You
 *          can subscribe to be notified through a CloudWatch event when your <code>RefreshCache</code>
 *          operation completes.</p>
 *          <p>Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no more than two
 *          refreshes at any time. We recommend using the refresh-complete CloudWatch event
 *          notification before issuing additional requests. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification">Getting
 *             notified about file operations</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 File Gateway User
 *             Guide</i>.</p>

 *                   <p>Wait at least 60 seconds between consecutive RefreshCache API requests.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>If you invoke the RefreshCache API when two requests are already being
 *                   processed, any new request will cause an
 *                      <code>InvalidGatewayRequestException</code> error because too many requests
 *                   were sent to the server.</p>

 *   FolderList: [ // FolderList
 *     "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ],
 *   Recursive: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new RefreshCacheCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // RefreshCacheOutput
 * //   FileShareARN: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   NotificationId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param RefreshCacheCommandInput - {@link RefreshCacheCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link RefreshCacheCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link RefreshCacheCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link RefreshCacheCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link StorageGatewayClientResolvedConfig | config} for StorageGatewayClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerError} (server fault)
 *  <p>An internal server error has occurred during the request. For more information, see the
 *          error and message fields.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidGatewayRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>An exception occurred because an invalid gateway request was issued to the service. For
