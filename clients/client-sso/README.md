## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript SSO Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>AWS Single Sign-On Portal is a web service that makes it easy for you to assign user
access to AWS SSO resources such as the user portal. Users can get AWS account applications
and roles assigned to them and get federated into the application.</p>

<p>For general information about AWS SSO, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is AWS
Single Sign-On?</a> in the <i>AWS SSO User Guide</i>.</p>

<p>This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO Portal operations that you can call
programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors.</p>

<note>
<p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
languages and platforms, such as Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a
convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more
information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-sso
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-sso`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-sso`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-sso`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `SSOClient` and
the commands you need, for example `GetRoleCredentialsCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { SSOClient, GetRoleCredentialsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sso");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { SSOClient, GetRoleCredentialsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sso";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new SSOClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new GetRoleCredentialsCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-sso";
const client = new AWS.SSO({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.getRoleCredentials(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .getRoleCredentials(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.getRoleCredentials(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
