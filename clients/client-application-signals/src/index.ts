 * <p>Use CloudWatch Application Signals for comprehensive observability of your cloud-based applications.
 *         It enables real-time service health dashboards and helps you track long-term performance trends against your business goals.
 *         The application-centric view provides you with unified visibility across your applications, services, and
 *         dependencies, so you can proactively monitor and efficiently triage any issues that may arise,
 *         ensuring optimal customer experience.</p>
 *          <p>Application Signals provides the following benefits:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Automatically collect metrics and traces from your applications, and display key metrics such as call volume, availability, latency, faults, and errors. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs). </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>See a map of your application topology that Application Signals automatically discovers, that gives you a visual representation of your applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>Application Signals works with CloudWatch RUM, CloudWatch Synthetics canaries, and Amazon Web Services Service Catalog AppRegistry, to display your client pages, Synthetics canaries,
 *         and application names within dashboards and maps.</p>
