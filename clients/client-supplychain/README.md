# @aws-sdk/client-supplychain

## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript SupplyChain Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>
AWS Supply Chain is a cloud-based application that works with your enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems. Using AWS Supply Chain, you can connect and extract your inventory, supply, and demand related data from existing ERP or supply chain systems into a single data model.
</p>
<p>The AWS Supply Chain API supports configuration data import for Supply Planning.</p>
<p>
All AWS Supply chain API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies.
</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-supplychain
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-supplychain`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-supplychain`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-supplychain`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `SupplyChainClient` and
the commands you need, for example `GetBillOfMaterialsImportJobCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { SupplyChainClient, GetBillOfMaterialsImportJobCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-supplychain");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { SupplyChainClient, GetBillOfMaterialsImportJobCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-supplychain";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new SupplyChainClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new GetBillOfMaterialsImportJobCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-supplychain";
const client = new AWS.SupplyChain({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.getBillOfMaterialsImportJob(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .getBillOfMaterialsImportJob(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.getBillOfMaterialsImportJob(params, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
