/**
 * <p>Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who
 *          need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data types, and
 *          errors. </p>
 *          <p>Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that you
 *          can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the
 *          effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance.</p>
 *          <p>Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments
 *          for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of controls with
 *          descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped according to the
 *          requirements of the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize
 *          frameworks and controls to support internal audits with specific requirements. </p>
