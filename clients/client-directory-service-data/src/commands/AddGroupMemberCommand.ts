/**
 * <p>Adds an existing user, group, or computer as a group member.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { DirectoryServiceDataClient, AddGroupMemberCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-directory-service-data"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { DirectoryServiceDataClient, AddGroupMemberCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-directory-service-data"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new DirectoryServiceDataClient(config);
 * const input = { // AddGroupMemberRequest
 *   DirectoryId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   GroupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   MemberName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   MemberRealm: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ClientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new AddGroupMemberCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param AddGroupMemberCommandInput - {@link AddGroupMemberCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link AddGroupMemberCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link AddGroupMemberCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link AddGroupMemberCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link DirectoryServiceDataClientResolvedConfig | config} for DirectoryServiceDataClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p> You don't have permission to perform the request or access the directory. It can also
 *       occur when the <code>DirectoryId</code> doesn't exist or the user, member, or group might be
 *       outside of your organizational unit (OU). </p>
 *          <p> Make sure that you have the authentication and authorization to perform the action.
 *       Review the directory information in the request, and make sure that the object isn't outside
 *       of your OU. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p> This error will occur when you try to create a resource that conflicts with an existing
 *       object. It can also occur when adding a member to a group that the member is already
 *       in.</p>
 *          <p> This error can be caused by a request sent within the 8-hour idempotency window with the
 *       same client token but different input parameters. Client tokens should not be re-used across
 *       different requests. After 8 hours, any request with the same client token is treated as a new
 *       request. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link DirectoryUnavailableException} (client fault)
 *  <p> The request could not be completed due to a problem in the configuration or current state
 *       of the specified directory. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p> The operation didn't succeed because an internal error occurred. Try again later. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p> The resource couldn't be found. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p> The limit on the number of requests per second has been exceeded. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p> The request isn't valid. Review the details in the error message to update the invalid
 *       parameters or values in your request. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link DirectoryServiceDataServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from DirectoryServiceData service.</p>
 *
 *
 * @example To add a member to the Marketing group
 * ```javascript
 * // The following command adds an existing user to the Marketing group in the europe.example.com domain.
 * const input = {
 *   ClientToken: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
