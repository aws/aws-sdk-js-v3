 * virtual machines, or containers. You can store, access, analyze, troubleshoot and take action on
 * this data without maintaining multiple log aggregators and reporting tools. After you run
 * <code>PutAuditEvents</code> to ingest your application activity into CloudTrail, you can use CloudTrail Lake to search, query, and analyze the data that is logged
 * from your applications.</p>
