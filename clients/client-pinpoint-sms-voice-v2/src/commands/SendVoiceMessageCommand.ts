/**
 * <p>Allows you to send a request that sends a voice message through Amazon Pinpoint.
 *             This operation uses <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/polly/">Amazon Polly</a> to
 *             convert a text script into a voice message.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { PinpointSMSVoiceV2Client, SendVoiceMessageCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-sms-voice-v2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { PinpointSMSVoiceV2Client, SendVoiceMessageCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-sms-voice-v2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PinpointSMSVoiceV2Client(config);
 * const input = { // SendVoiceMessageRequest
 *   DestinationPhoneNumber: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   OriginationIdentity: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   MessageBody: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   MessageBodyTextType: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   VoiceId: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ConfigurationSetName: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   MaxPricePerMinute: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   TimeToLive: Number("int"),
 *   Context: { // ContextMap
 *     "<keys>": "STRING_VALUE",
 *   },
 *   DryRun: true || false,
 *   ProtectConfigurationId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new SendVoiceMessageCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // SendVoiceMessageResult
 * //   MessageId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param SendVoiceMessageCommandInput - {@link SendVoiceMessageCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link SendVoiceMessageCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link SendVoiceMessageCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link SendVoiceMessageCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link PinpointSMSVoiceV2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for PinpointSMSVoiceV2Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because you don't have sufficient permissions to access the
 *             resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Your request has conflicting operations. This can occur if you're trying to perform
 *             more than one operation on the same resource at the same time or it could be that the
 *             requested action isn't valid for the current state or configuration of the
 *             resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The API encountered an unexpected error and couldn't complete the request. You might
 *             be able to successfully issue the request again in the future.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A requested resource couldn't be found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceQuotaExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request would cause a service quota to be exceeded.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>An error that occurred because too many requests were sent during a certain amount of
 *             time.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A validation exception for a field.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PinpointSMSVoiceV2ServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from PinpointSMSVoiceV2 service.</p>
