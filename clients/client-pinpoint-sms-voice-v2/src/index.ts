 *             <b>Regional availability</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>The <i>Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API Reference</i> is
 *             available in several Amazon Web Services Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of
 *             these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently
 *             available, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">Amazon Web Services Service Endpoints</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/pinpoint.html">Amazon Pinpoint
 *                 endpoints and quotas</a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To
 *             learn more about Amazon Web Services Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing
 *                     Amazon Web Services Regions</a> in the Amazon Web Services General
 *             Reference.</p>
 *          <p>In each Region, Amazon Web Services maintains multiple Availability Zones. These
 *             Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
 *             low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
 *             Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy,
 *             while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that
 *             are available in each Region, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">Amazon Web Services
 *                 Global Infrastructure.</a>
