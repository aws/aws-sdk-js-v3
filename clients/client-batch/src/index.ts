 * <fullname>Batch</fullname>
 *          <p>Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for
 *    developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of
 *    the batch computing to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure.
 *    At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently
 *    provision resources, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing your overall compute costs, and
 *    delivering results more quickly.</p>
 *          <p>As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically
 *    provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
 *    workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus
 *    on analyzing results and solving your specific problems instead.</p>
