 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service. It makes
 * 			it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a
 * 			serverless infrastructure that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on
 * 			Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
 * 			or External (on-premises) instances that you manage.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API
 * 			calls. This makes it easy to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service,
 * 			and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p>
 *          <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on
 * 			your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you
 * 			don't need to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems.
 * 			You also don't need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure. </p>
