## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript ECS Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>

<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes
it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your
cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your
services or tasks on AWS Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster
of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage.</p>
<p>Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API
calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives
you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p>
<p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on
your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates
the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management
systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-ecs
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-ecs`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-ecs`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-ecs`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `ECSClient` and
the commands you need, for example `CreateCapacityProviderCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { ECSClient, CreateCapacityProviderCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ecs");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { ECSClient, CreateCapacityProviderCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ecs";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new ECSClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new CreateCapacityProviderCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-ecs";
const client = new AWS.ECS({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.createCapacityProvider(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .createCapacityProvider(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.createCapacityProvider(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
