/**
 * <p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of
 *          your Amazon Web Services environment and resources. It also provides you with the readiness
 *          status of your environment based on controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and
 *          integrated third-party products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment
 *          to identify the highest priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
 *                <i>Security Hub User
 * Guide</i>
 *             </a>.</p>
 *          <p>When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in
 *          the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change
 *          that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in
 *          other Regions, run the same command for each Region in which you want to apply the change.</p>
 *          <p>For example, if your Region is set to <code>us-west-2</code>, when you use <code>CreateMembers</code> to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of
 *          the member account with the administrator account is created only in the <code>us-west-2</code>
 *          Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invitation
 *          was sent from.</p>
 *          <p>The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.</p>
 *          <ul>

 *                second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of 1 request per second.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>GetFindings</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 3 requests per second.
