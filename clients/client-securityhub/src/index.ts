 * <p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in Amazon Web Services and helps
 *            you assess your Amazon Web Services environment against security industry standards and best practices.</p>
 *          <p>Security Hub collects security data across Amazon Web Services accounts, Amazon Web Services, and
 *             supported third-party products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security
 *             issues.</p>
 *          <p>To help you manage the security state of your organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards.
 *            These include the Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed by Amazon Web Services,
 *             and external compliance frameworks such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment Card Industry Data
 *             Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes
 *             several security controls, each of which represents a security best practice. Security Hub runs checks against
 *             security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your compliance against security best practices.</p>
 *          <p>In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub also receives findings from other Amazon Web Services,
 *             such as Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and
 *             supported third-party products. This gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related issues. You
 *             can also send Security Hub findings to other Amazon Web Services and supported third-party products.</p>
 *          <p>Security Hub offers automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues. For example,
 *            you can use automation rules to automatically update critical findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the integration with
 *            Amazon EventBridge  to trigger automatic responses to specific findings.</p>
 *          <p>This guide, the <i>Security Hub API Reference</i>, provides
 *            information about the Security Hub API. This includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters,
 *            and schemas. If you're new to Security Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
 *                <i>Security Hub User Guide</i>
 *             </a>. The
 *            user guide explains key concepts and provides procedures
 *            that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features. It also provides information about topics such as
 *            integrating Security Hub with other Amazon Web Services.</p>
 *          <p>In addition to interacting with Security Hub  by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can
 *            use a current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon Web Services provides tools
 *             and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell,
 *            Java, Go, Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient, programmatic access to
 *            Security Hub  and other Amazon Web Services . They also handle tasks such as signing requests,
 *            managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about installing and using the Amazon Web Services  tools
 *            and SDKs, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
 *          <p>With the exception of operations that are related to central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed only in
 *          the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change
 *          that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in
 *          other Regions, call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the change. When you use central configuration,
 * API requests for enabling Security Hub, standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and all linked Regions. For a list of
 * central configuration operations, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/central-configuration-intro.html#central-configuration-concepts">Central configuration
 * terms and concepts</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User Guide</i>.</p>
