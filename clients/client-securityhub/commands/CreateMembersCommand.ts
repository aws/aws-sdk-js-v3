/**
 * <p>Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account
 *          used to make the request, which is the administrator account. If you are integrated with
 *          Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <code>CreateMembers</code> is always used to add accounts that are not organization
 *          members.</p>
 *          <p>For accounts that are managed using Organizations, <code>CreateMembers</code> is only used
 *          in the following cases:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization accounts.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you
 *          can use the <code>EnableSecurityHub</code> operation.</p>
 *          <p>For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and
 *          then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the
 *                <code>InviteMembers</code> operation. If the account owner accepts
 *          the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub.</p>
 *          <p>Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They
 *          automatically become a member account in Security Hub, and Security Hub is automatically enabled for those accounts. Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a member account.</p>
 *          <p>A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings
 *          generated in the member account. When Security Hub is enabled in a member account, the member account findings are
 *          also visible to the administrator account. </p>
 *          <p>To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the <code>DisassociateFromMasterAccount</code> or <code>DisassociateMembers</code> operation.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SecurityHubClient, CreateMembersCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-securityhub"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SecurityHubClient, CreateMembersCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-securityhub"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SecurityHubClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateMembersCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateMembersCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateMembersCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SecurityHubClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
