/**
 * <p>Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of
 *       the state. You can disable a rule using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_DisableRule.html">DisableRule</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by Amazon Web Services services
 *       go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or
 *       applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or
 *       services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event
 *       bus that you have created. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEventBus.html">CreateEventBus</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this
 *         <code>PutRule</code> command. If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the old values
 *       for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values.</p>
 *
 *          <p>When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to
 *       new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p>
 *
 *          <p>A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with
 *       EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions
 *       self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a
 *       ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a
 *       schedule.</p>
 *
 *          <p>When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule.
 *       Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user
 *       permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag
 *       values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and assign tags, you must have both the
 *         <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code> permissions.</p>
 *          <p>If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code>
 *       operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html">TagResource</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html">UntagResource</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Most services in Amazon Web Services treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
 *       However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the
 *       correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the
 *       event you want to match.</p>
 *
 *          <p>In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule
 *       is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket,
 *       and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written
 *       carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite
 *       loop.</p>
 *          <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same
 *       rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead
 *       of after any change. </p>
 *          <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use
 *       budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information,
 *       see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html">Managing Your Costs with
 *         Budgets</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudWatchEventsClient, PutRuleCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-events"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudWatchEventsClient, PutRuleCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-events"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudWatchEventsClient(config);
 * const command = new PutRuleCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link PutRuleCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutRuleCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudWatchEventsClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
