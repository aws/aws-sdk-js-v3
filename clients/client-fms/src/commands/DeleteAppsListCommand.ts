 * // const { FMSClient, DeleteAppsListCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-fms"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new FMSClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteAppsListRequest
 *   ListId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteAppsListCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteAppsListCommandInput - {@link DeleteAppsListCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteAppsListCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteAppsListCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteAppsListCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link FMSClientResolvedConfig | config} for FMSClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalErrorException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because of a system problem, even though the request was valid. Retry
 *       your request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidOperationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because there was nothing to do or the operation wasn't possible. For example, you might have
 *         submitted an <code>AssociateAdminAccount</code> request for an account ID that
 *             was already set as the Firewall Manager administrator. Or you might have tried to access a Region
 *   that's disabled by default, and that you need to enable for the Firewall Manager
 *   administrator account and for Organizations before you can access it.</p>
