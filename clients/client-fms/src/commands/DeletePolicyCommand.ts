/**
 * <p>Permanently deletes an Firewall Manager policy. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { FMSClient, DeletePolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-fms"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { FMSClient, DeletePolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-fms"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new FMSClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeletePolicyRequest
 *   PolicyId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   DeleteAllPolicyResources: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new DeletePolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeletePolicyCommandInput - {@link DeletePolicyCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeletePolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeletePolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeletePolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link FMSClientResolvedConfig | config} for FMSClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalErrorException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because of a system problem, even though the request was valid. Retry
 *       your request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidInputException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The parameters of the request were invalid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidOperationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation failed because there was nothing to do or the operation wasn't possible. For example, you might have
 *         submitted an <code>AssociateAdminAccount</code> request for an account ID that
 *             was already set as the Firewall Manager administrator. Or you might have tried to access a Region
 *   that's disabled by default, and that you need to enable for the Firewall Manager
 *   administrator account and for Organizations before you can access it.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link LimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The operation exceeds a resource limit, for example, the maximum number of
 *         <code>policy</code> objects that you can create for an Amazon Web Services account. For more information,
 *       see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/fms-limits.html">Firewall
 *         Manager Limits</a> in the <i>WAF Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified resource was not found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link FMSServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from FMS service.</p>
