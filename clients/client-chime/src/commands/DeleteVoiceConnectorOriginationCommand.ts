 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ChimeClient, DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-chime"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ChimeClient, DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-chime"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ChimeClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationRequest
 *   VoiceConnectorId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationCommandInput - {@link DeleteVoiceConnectorOriginationCommandInput}
