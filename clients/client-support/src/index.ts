 *          <p>The <i>Amazon Web Services Support API Reference</i> is intended for programmers who need detailed
 *             information about the Amazon Web Services Support operations and data types. You can use the API to manage
 *             your support cases programmatically. The Amazon Web Services Support API uses HTTP methods that return
 *             results in JSON format.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support
 *                         API. </p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a
 *                         Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the
 *                             <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For
 *                         information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services Support</a>.</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ul>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>You can also use the Amazon Web Services Support API to access features for <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">Trusted Advisor</a>. You can return a list of
 *             checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the
 *             refresh status of checks.</p>
 *          <p>You can manage your support cases with the following Amazon Web Services Support API operations:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>, <a>DescribeAttachment</a>, and <a>ResolveCase</a> operations
 *                     create Amazon Web Services Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The <a>DescribeCommunications</a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a>, and <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a> operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to Amazon Web Services Support
 *                     cases.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return Amazon Web Service names, service codes, service categories, and problem
 *                     severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase</a> operation.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>You can also use the Amazon Web Services Support API to call the  Trusted Advisor operations. For more
 *             information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">Trusted Advisor</a> in the
 *                 <i>Amazon Web Services Support User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>For authentication of requests, Amazon Web Services Support uses <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing
 *                 Process</a>.</p>
