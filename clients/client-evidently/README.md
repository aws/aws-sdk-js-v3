# @aws-sdk/client-evidently

## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript Evidently Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving
them to a specified percentage
of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature
to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you
reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.</p>
<p>You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence
and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects
experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It also provides clear
recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features
and backend features.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-evidently
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-evidently`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-evidently`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-evidently`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `EvidentlyClient` and
the commands you need, for example `ListProjectsCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { EvidentlyClient, ListProjectsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-evidently");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { EvidentlyClient, ListProjectsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-evidently";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by different commands.
const client = new EvidentlyClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new ListProjectsCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-evidently";
const client = new AWS.Evidently({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.listProjects(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .listProjects(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.listProjects(params, (err, data) => {
  // process err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
