/**
 * <p>Deletes an Evidently project. Before you can delete a project, you must delete all the
 *       features that the project contains. To delete a feature, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteFeature.html">DeleteFeature</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EvidentlyClient, DeleteProjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-evidently"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EvidentlyClient, DeleteProjectCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-evidently"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EvidentlyClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteProjectRequest
 *   project: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteProjectCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteProjectCommandInput - {@link DeleteProjectCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteProjectCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteProjectCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteProjectCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EvidentlyClientResolvedConfig | config} for EvidentlyClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient permissions to perform this action. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A resource was in an inconsistent state during an update or a deletion.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request references a resource that does not exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because of request throttling. Retry the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The value of a parameter in the request caused an error.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link EvidentlyServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from Evidently service.</p>
