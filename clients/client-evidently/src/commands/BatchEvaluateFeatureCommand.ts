/**
 * <p>This operation assigns feature variation to user sessions. For each user session, you pass
 *       in an <code>entityID</code> that represents the user. Evidently then checks the evaluation
 *       rules and assigns the variation.</p>
 *          <p>The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules. If the user's
 *         <code>entityID</code> matches an override rule, the user is served the variation specified
 *       by that rule.</p>
 *          <p>Next, if there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to a variation in
 *       the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that
 *       launch. If the user is enrolled in the launch, the variation they are served depends on the
 *       allocation of the various feature variations used for the launch.</p>
 *          <p>If the user is not assigned to a launch, and there is an ongoing experiment for this feature,  the user might
 *       be assigned to a variation in the experiment. The chance of this
 *       depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that experiment. If the user is enrolled in the experiment,
 *       the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the experiment. </p>
 *          <p>If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served the default variation.</p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EvidentlyClient, BatchEvaluateFeatureCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-evidently"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EvidentlyClient, BatchEvaluateFeatureCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-evidently"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EvidentlyClient(config);
 * const input = { // BatchEvaluateFeatureRequest
 *   project: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   requests: [ // EvaluationRequestsList // required
 *     { // EvaluationRequest
 *       feature: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *       entityId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *       evaluationContext: "STRING_VALUE",
 *     },
 *   ],
 * };
 * const command = new BatchEvaluateFeatureCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // BatchEvaluateFeatureResponse
 * //   results: [ // EvaluationResultsList
 * //     { // EvaluationResult
 * //       project: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //       feature: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //       variation: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //       value: { // VariableValue Union: only one key present
 * //         boolValue: true || false,
 * //         stringValue: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //         longValue: Number("long"),
 * //         doubleValue: Number("double"),
 * //       },
 * //       entityId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //       reason: "STRING_VALUE",
