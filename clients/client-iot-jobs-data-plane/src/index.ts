/**
 * <p>AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote operations that are sent to
 *          and executed on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a
 *          set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform
 *          remote troubleshooting operations.</p>
 *          <p> To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be
 *          performed, and you specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual
 *          things, thing groups or both.</p>
 *          <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the
 *          execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its
 *          progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and
 *          for all the targets of the job</p>
