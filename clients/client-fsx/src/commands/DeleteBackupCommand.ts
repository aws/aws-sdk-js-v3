/**
 * <p>Deletes an Amazon FSx backup. After deletion, the backup no longer exists, and

 *          <p>The <code>DeleteBackup</code> call returns instantly. The backup won't show up in
 *             later <code>DescribeBackups</code> calls.</p>
 *          <important>

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { FSxClient, DeleteBackupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-fsx"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { FSxClient, DeleteBackupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-fsx"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new FSxClient(config);

 * const command = new DeleteBackupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeleteBackupResponse
 * //   BackupId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   Lifecycle: "AVAILABLE" || "CREATING" || "TRANSFERRING" || "DELETED" || "FAILED" || "PENDING" || "COPYING",
