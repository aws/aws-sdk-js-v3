 * <fullname>Backup gateway</fullname>
 *          <p>Backup gateway connects Backup to your hypervisor, so you can
 *       create, store, and restore backups of your virtual machines (VMs) anywhere, whether
 *       on-premises or in the VMware Cloud (VMC) on Amazon Web Services.</p>
 *          <p>Add on-premises resources by connecting to a hypervisor through a gateway. Backup will automatically discover the resources in your hypervisor.</p>
 *          <p>Use Backup to assign virtual or on-premises resources to a backup plan, or run
 *       on-demand backups. Once you have backed up your resources, you can view them and restore them
 *       like any resource supported by Backup.</p>
 *          <p>To download the Amazon Web Services software to get started, navigate to the Backup console, choose <b>Gateways</b>, then choose <b>Create gateway</b>.</p>
