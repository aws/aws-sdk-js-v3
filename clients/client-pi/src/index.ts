 * <fullname>Amazon RDS Performance Insights</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a running DB instance. The guide
 *             provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors.</p>
 *          <p>When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the
 *             authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load.</p>
 *          <p>DB load is measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension
 *             provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested
 *             dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.</p>
