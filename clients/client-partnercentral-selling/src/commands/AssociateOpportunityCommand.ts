/**
 * <p>Enables you to create a formal association between an <code>Opportunity</code> and various related entities, enriching the context and details of the opportunity for better collaboration and decision making. You can associate an opportunity with the following entity types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Partner Solution: A software product or consulting practice created and delivered by Partners. Partner Solutions help customers address business challenges using Amazon Web Services services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Web Services Products: Amazon Web Services offers many products and services that provide scalable, reliable, and cost-effective infrastructure solutions. For the latest list of Amazon Web Services products, see <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/partner-crm-integration-samples/blob/main/resources/aws_products.json">Amazon Web Services products</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Web Services Marketplace private offer: Allows Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers to extend custom pricing and terms to individual Amazon Web Services customers. Sellers can negotiate custom prices, payment schedules, and end user license terms through private offers, enabling Amazon Web Services customers to acquire software solutions tailored to their specific needs. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-private-offers.html">Private offers in Amazon Web Services Marketplace</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To obtain identifiers for these entities, use the following methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Solution: Use the <code>ListSolutions</code> operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS Products: For the latest list of Amazon Web Services products, see <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/partner-crm-integration-samples/blob/main/resources/aws_products.json">Amazon Web Services products</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Web Services Marketplace private offer: Use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/catalog-apis.html">Using the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Catalog API</a> to list entities. Specifically, use the <code>ListEntities</code> operation to retrieve a list of private offers. The request returns the details of available private offers. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_ListEntities.html">ListEntities</a>.</p> </li> </ul>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.

 * // const { PartnerCentralSellingClient, AssociateOpportunityCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-partnercentral-selling"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PartnerCentralSellingClient(config);
 * const input = { // AssociateOpportunityRequest
 *   Catalog: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   OpportunityIdentifier: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   RelatedEntityType: "Solutions" || "AwsProducts" || "AwsMarketplaceOffers", // required
 *   RelatedEntityIdentifier: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new AssociateOpportunityCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param AssociateOpportunityCommandInput - {@link AssociateOpportunityCommandInput}
