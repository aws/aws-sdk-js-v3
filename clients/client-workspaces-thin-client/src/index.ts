 * <p>Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client is a affordable device built to work with Amazon Web Services End User
 *             Computing (EUC) virtual desktops to provide users with a complete cloud desktop
 *             solution. WorkSpaces Thin Client is a compact device designed to connect up to two monitors and USB
 *             devices like a keyboard, mouse, headset, and webcam. To maximize endpoint security, WorkSpaces Thin Client
 *             devices do not allow local data storage or installation of unapproved applications. The
 *             WorkSpaces Thin Client device ships preloaded with device management software.</p>
 *          <p>You can use these APIs to complete WorkSpaces Thin Client tasks, such as creating environments or
 *             viewing devices. For more information about WorkSpaces Thin Client, including the required permissions to
 *             use the service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces-thin-client/latest/ag/">Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client Administrator Guide</a>. For
 *             more information about using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage
 *             your WorkSpaces Thin Client resources, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces-thin-client/index.html">WorkSpaces Thin Client section of the
