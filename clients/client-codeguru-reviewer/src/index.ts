 * <p>This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a
 *          service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect potential defects that
 *          are difficult for developers to find and recommends fixes in your Java and Python
 *          code.</p>
 *          <p>By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing code defects and
 *          implementing best practices, CodeGuru Reviewer improves the overall quality and maintainability of
 *          your code base during the code review stage. For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the

 *          </p>
 *          <p>To improve the security of your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can establish a private connection
 *          between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by creating an <i>interface VPC endpoint</i>. For
