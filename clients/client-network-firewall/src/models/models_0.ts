   *       When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group

   *          <p>You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling
   *       <a>CreateRuleGroup</a> with <code>DryRun</code> set to <code>TRUE</code>. </p>
   *          <note>
   *             <p>You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group, so leave

   *          </p>
   *          <p>For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity
   *          requirements of the individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group. </p>
   *          <p>To calculate the capacity requirement of a single rule, multiply the capacity
   *          requirement values of each of the rule's match settings:</p>
   *          <ul>
   *             <li>
   *                <p>A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1. </p>
   *             </li>
   *             <li>
   *                <p>A match setting with <code>Any</code> specified has a value of 1. </p>
   *             </li>
   *             <li>
   *                <p>All other match settings have a value equal to the number of elements provided in
   *                the setting. For example, a protocol setting ["UDP"] and a source setting
   *                ["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"] has a value
   *                of 2. A source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a value of 3.
   *             </p>
   *             </li>
   *          </ul>
   *          <p>A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity
   *          requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"], source setting
   *          ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specification or no specification
   *          for each of the other match settings has a capacity requirement of 6. </p>
