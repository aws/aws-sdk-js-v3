   *             <li>

   *                <p>All other match settings have a value equal to the number of elements provided in

   *                ["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"] has a value
   *                of 2. A source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a value of 3.

   *          <p>A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity
