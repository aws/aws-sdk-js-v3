/**
 * @public
 * <p>Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route. The account owner of the service resource is always the
 *       environment owner, regardless of which account creates the route. Routes target a service in
 *       the application. If an application does not have any routes, then the first route must be
 *       created as a <code>DEFAULT</code>
 *             <code>RouteType</code>.</p>
 *          <p>When created, the default route defaults to an active state so state is not a required
 *       input. However, like all other state values the state of the default route can be updated
 *       after creation, but only when all other routes are also inactive. Conversely, no route can be
 *       active without the default route also being active.</p>
 *          <p>When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API Gateway to send traffic
 *       to the target service as follows:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a private IP address,
 *           Refactor Spaces routes traffic using the API Gateway VPC link. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a public IP address,
 *           Refactor Spaces routes traffic over the public internet.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor Spaces
 *           configures the Lambda function's resource policy to allow the application's
 *             API Gateway to invoke the function.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>A one-time health check is performed on the service when either the route is updated from
 *       inactive to active, or when it is created with an active state. If the health check fails, the
 *       route transitions the route state to <code>FAILED</code>, an error code of
 *         <code>SERVICE_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURE</code> is provided, and no traffic is sent to
 *       the service.</p>
 *          <p>For Lambda functions, the Lambda function state is checked. If the
 *       function is not active, the function configuration is updated so that Lambda
 *       resources are provisioned. If the Lambda state is <code>Failed</code>, then the
 *       route creation fails. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionConfiguration.html#SSS-GetFunctionConfiguration-response-State">GetFunctionConfiguration's State response parameter</a> in the <i>Lambda Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>For Lambda endpoints, a check is performed to determine that a Lambda function with the
 *       specified ARN exists. If it does not exist, the health check fails. For public URLs, a
 *       connection is opened to the public endpoint. If the URL is not reachable, the health check
 *       fails. </p>
 *          <p>Refactor Spaces automatically resolves the public Domain Name System (DNS) names that are set in
 *         <a>CreateServiceRequest$UrlEndpoint</a> when you create a service. The DNS names
 *       resolve when the DNS time-to-live (TTL) expires, or every 60 seconds for TTLs less than 60
 *       seconds. This periodic DNS resolution ensures that the route configuration remains up-to-date. </p>
 *          <p>For private URLS, a target group is created on the Elastic Load Balancing and the target
 *       group health check is run. The <code>HealthCheckProtocol</code>, <code>HealthCheckPort</code>,
 *       and <code>HealthCheckPath</code> are the same protocol, port, and path specified in the URL or
 *       health URL, if used. All other settings use the default values, as described in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html">Health checks
 *         for your target groups</a>. The health check is considered successful if at least one
 *       target within the target group transitions to a healthy state.</p>
 *          <p>Services can have HTTP or HTTPS URL endpoints. For HTTPS URLs, publicly-signed
 *       certificates are supported. Private Certificate Authorities (CAs) are permitted only if the
 *       CA's domain is also publicly resolvable.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { MigrationHubRefactorSpacesClient, CreateRouteCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-migration-hub-refactor-spaces"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { MigrationHubRefactorSpacesClient, CreateRouteCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-migration-hub-refactor-spaces"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new MigrationHubRefactorSpacesClient(config);
 * const input = { // CreateRouteRequest
