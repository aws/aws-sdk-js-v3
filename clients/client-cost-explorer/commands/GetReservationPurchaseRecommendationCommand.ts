/**
 * <p>Gets recommendations for which reservations to purchase. These recommendations could help you reduce your costs.
 * 			Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.</p>
 * 		       <p>AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage
 * 			into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations
 * 			in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings. </p>
 * 		       <p>For example, AWS automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region
 * 			and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends the smallest size instance
 * 			in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units
 * 			so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for <code>c4.large</code>
 * 			because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.</p>
