/**
 * <p>Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your
 *             custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing resources for
 *             your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance.</p>
 *         <p>Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home
 *             Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that
 *             are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N.
 *             Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland),
 *             ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that
 *             are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home Region
 *             only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however,
 *             you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.</p>
 *         <p>To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build
 *             or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift how
 *             to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound
 *             traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a
 *             multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.</p>
 *
 *         <p>If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in
 *                 <code>NEW</code> status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creation-workflow.html">fleet creation
 *                 workflow</a>. You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using <a>DescribeFleetAttributes</a> and <a>DescribeFleetLocationAttributes</a>/, or by monitoring fleet creation events
 *             using <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a>. As soon as the fleet status changes to
 *                 <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can enable automatic scaling for the fleet with <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> and set capacity for the home Region with <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>. When the status of each remote location reaches
 *                 <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can set capacity by location using <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>.</p>
