/**
 * <p>Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions.
 *             The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new
 *             matches. Backfill
 *             requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide
 *             matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information
 *             to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements. </p>
 *         <p>When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from
 *             a client service by calling this operation with a <a>GameSession</a>
 *             identifier. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game
 *             server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players,
 *             updates the <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the
 *             game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is
 *             started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a
 *             subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request.</p>
 *         <p>When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation
 *         without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned
 *         in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled.</p>
 *         <p>To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking
 *             configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being
 *             backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a match
 *             backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of
 *             backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.</p>
