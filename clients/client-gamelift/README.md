## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript GameLift Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname>

<p>GameLift provides solutions for hosting session-based multiplayer game servers in the
cloud, including tools for deploying, operating, and scaling game servers. Built on AWS
global computing infrastructure, GameLift helps you deliver high-performance,
high-reliability, low-cost game servers while dynamically scaling your resource usage to
meet player demand. </p>
<p>
<b>About GameLift solutions</b>
</p>
<p>Get more information on these GameLift solutions in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/">Amazon GameLift Developer Guide</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managed GameLift -- GameLift offers a
fully managed service to set up and maintain computing machines for
hosting, manage game session and player session life cycle, and handle
security, storage, and performance tracking. You can use automatic
scaling tools to balance hosting costs against meeting player demand.,
configure your game session management to minimize player latency, or
add FlexMatch for matchmaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managed GameLift with Realtime Servers – With GameLift Realtime Servers, you can quickly configure and set up game
servers for your game. Realtime Servers provides a game server framework with core Amazon GameLift
infrastructure already built in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GameLift FleetIQ – Use GameLift FleetIQ as a standalone feature while managing your own EC2 instances and Auto
Scaling groups for game hosting. GameLift FleetIQ provides optimizations that make low-cost
Spot Instances viable for game hosting. </p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-gamelift
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-gamelift`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-gamelift`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-gamelift`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `GameLiftClient` and
the commands you need, for example `AcceptMatchCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { GameLiftClient, AcceptMatchCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gamelift");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { GameLiftClient, AcceptMatchCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-gamelift";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new GameLiftClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new AcceptMatchCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-gamelift";
const client = new AWS.GameLift({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.acceptMatch(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .acceptMatch(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.acceptMatch(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
