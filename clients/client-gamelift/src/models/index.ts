 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the
 *                     match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might
 *                     describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player
 *                     characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that
 *                     use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute
 *                     values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or
 *                     level.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a
 *                     match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for
 *                     individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require
 *                     each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player
 *                     in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may
 *                     describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at
 *                     least one player in a certain role. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a
 *                     period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you
 *                     balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of
 *                     making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you
 *                     might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players
 *                     after 30 seconds.</p>
 *             </li>
