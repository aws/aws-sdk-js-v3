 *                     individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require
 *                     each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player
 *                     in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may
 *                     describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at

 *                     balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of
 *                     making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you
