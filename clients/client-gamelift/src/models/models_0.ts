 *                     and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a
 *                     4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled. </p>

 *                     use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute
 *                     values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or

 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match
 *                     based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for
 *                     individual players, teams, or entire matches. For example, a rule might require
 *                     each player to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least one player
 *                     in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may
 *                     describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at
 *                     least one player in a certain role. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period
 *                     of time when no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance
 *                     getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them
 *                     wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an
 *                     expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30
 *                     seconds.</p>
