/**
 * @public
 * <p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to
 *             automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling
 *             policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's
 *             capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:
 *             target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage
 *             fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you
 *             need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p>
 *          <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you
 *             can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both.
 *             We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have
 *             unintended consequences.</p>
 *          <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic
 *                 Scaling</a>.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Target-based policy</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This
 *             metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions
 *             but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional
 *             player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based
 *             policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is
 *             needed to maintain that target. </p>
 *          <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the
 *             capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action
 *             whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions.
 *             Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10%
 *             buffer. </p>
 *          <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the
 *             policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)
 *             and reference a <code>TargetConfiguration</code> object with your desired buffer value.
 *             Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The
 *             scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the
 *             fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force
 *             once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Rule-based policy</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and
 *             specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you
 *             can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale
 *             up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p>
 *          <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle
 *             instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity
 *             by 10%."</p>
 *          <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p>
 *          <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code>
 *             <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then
 *                 <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p>
 *          <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p>
 *          <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code>
 *             <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then
 *                 <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p>
 *          <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet
 *             ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy
 *             rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies
 *             are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's
 *             auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the
 *             fleet actions are restarted.</p>

 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
