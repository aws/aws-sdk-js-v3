 * <p>
 *             <b>This operation has been expanded to use with the Amazon GameLift containers feature, which is currently in public preview.</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Adds remote locations to an EC2 or container fleet and begins populating the new
 *             locations with instances. The new instances conform to the fleet's instance type,
 *             auto-scaling, and other configuration settings.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>You can't add remote locations to a fleet that resides in an Amazon Web Services Region that
 *                 doesn't support multiple locations. Fleets created prior to March 2021 can't support
 *                 multiple locations.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a list of one or
 *             more locations. </p>
 *          <p>If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status
 *             set to <code>NEW</code>. Amazon GameLift initiates the process of starting an instance in each
 *             added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location
 *             creation events using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetEvents.html">DescribeFleetEvents</a>.</p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GameLiftClient, CreateFleetLocationsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GameLiftClient, CreateFleetLocationsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
 * const input = { // CreateFleetLocationsInput
 *   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   Locations: [ // LocationConfigurationList // required
 *     { // LocationConfiguration
 *       Location: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *     },
 *   ],
 * };
 * const command = new CreateFleetLocationsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // CreateFleetLocationsOutput
 * //   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   FleetArn: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   LocationStates: [ // LocationStateList
 * //     { // LocationState
 * //       Location: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //       Status: "NEW" || "DOWNLOADING" || "VALIDATING" || "BUILDING" || "ACTIVATING" || "ACTIVE" || "DELETING" || "ERROR" || "TERMINATED" || "NOT_FOUND",
 * //     },
