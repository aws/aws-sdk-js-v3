 * <p>Adds remote locations to a fleet and begins populating the new locations with EC2
 *             instances. The new instances conform to the fleet's instance type, auto-scaling, and
 *             other configuration settings. </p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>This operation cannot be used with fleets that don't support remote locations.
 *                 Fleets can have multiple locations only if they reside in Amazon Web Services Regions that support
 *                 this feature and were created after the feature was released in March 2021.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a list of one or
 *             more locations. </p>
 *          <p>If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status
 *             set to <code>NEW</code>. Amazon GameLift initiates the process of starting an instance in each
 *             added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location
 *             creation events using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetEvents.html">DescribeFleetEvents</a>.</p>

 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
 * const input = { // CreateFleetLocationsInput

 *   Locations: [ // LocationConfigurationList // required
 *     { // LocationConfiguration
 *       Location: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *     },
 *   ],
 * };
 * const command = new CreateFleetLocationsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // CreateFleetLocationsOutput
 * //   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   FleetArn: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   LocationStates: [ // LocationStateList
