/**
 * <p>Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players. New player sessions can
 *             be created in any game session with an open slot that is in <code>ACTIVE</code> status
 *             and has a player creation policy of <code>ACCEPT_ALL</code>. To add a single player to a
 *             game session, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreatePlayerSession.html">CreatePlayerSession</a>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>To create player sessions, specify a game session ID and a list of player IDs.
 *             Optionally, provide a set of player data for each player ID. </p>
 *          <p>If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each player, and new
 *                 <code>PlayerSession</code> objects are returned with player session IDs. Each player
 *             references their player session ID when sending a connection request to the game
 *             session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the
 *             Amazon GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.</p>
 *          <p>The maximum number of players per game session is 200. It is not adjustable. </p>

 *   PlayerDataMap: { // PlayerDataMap

 * const command = new CreatePlayerSessionsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);

 * @throws {@link GameSessionFullException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The game instance is currently full and cannot allow the requested player(s) to join.
 *             Clients can retry such requests immediately or after a waiting period.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServiceException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The service encountered an unrecoverable internal failure while processing the
 *             request. Clients can retry such requests immediately or after a waiting period.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidGameSessionStatusException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested operation would cause a conflict with the current state of a resource

 *
 * @throws {@link NotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>THe requested resources was not found. The resource was either not created yet or deleted.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TerminalRoutingStrategyException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The service is unable to resolve the routing for a particular alias because it has a
 *             terminal <code>RoutingStrategy</code> associated with it. The message returned in this
 *             exception is the message defined in the routing strategy itself. Such requests should
