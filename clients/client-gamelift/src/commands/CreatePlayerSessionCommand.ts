/**
 * <p>Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player. New player sessions can
 *             be created in any game session with an open slot that is in <code>ACTIVE</code> status
 *             and has a player creation policy of <code>ACCEPT_ALL</code>. You can add a group of
 *             players to a game session with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreatePlayerSessions.html">CreatePlayerSessions</a> . </p>
 *          <p>To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a set
 *             of player data. </p>
 *          <p>If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for the player and a new
 *                 <code>PlayerSessions</code> object is returned with a player session ID. The player
 *             references the player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session,
 *             and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the Amazon GameLift
 *             service. Player sessions cannot be updated. </p>
 *          <p>The maximum number of players per game session is 200. It is not adjustable. </p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GameLiftClient, CreatePlayerSessionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GameLiftClient, CreatePlayerSessionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
 * const input = { // CreatePlayerSessionInput
 *   GameSessionId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   PlayerId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   PlayerData: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new CreatePlayerSessionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // CreatePlayerSessionOutput
 * //   PlayerSession: { // PlayerSession
 * //     PlayerSessionId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     PlayerId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     GameSessionId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     FleetId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     FleetArn: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     CreationTime: new Date("TIMESTAMP"),
 * //     TerminationTime: new Date("TIMESTAMP"),
 * //     Status: "RESERVED" || "ACTIVE" || "COMPLETED" || "TIMEDOUT",
 * //     IpAddress: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     DnsName: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     Port: Number("int"),
 * //     PlayerData: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   },
 * // };

 * @throws {@link GameSessionFullException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The game instance is currently full and cannot allow the requested player(s) to join.
 *             Clients can retry such requests immediately or after a waiting period.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServiceException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The service encountered an unrecoverable internal failure while processing the
 *             request. Clients can retry such requests immediately or after a waiting period.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidGameSessionStatusException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested operation would cause a conflict with the current state of a resource
 *             associated with the request and/or the game instance. Resolve the conflict before
 *             retrying.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>One or more parameter values in the request are invalid. Correct the invalid parameter
 *             values before retrying.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>THe requested resources was not found. The resource was either not created yet or deleted.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TerminalRoutingStrategyException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The service is unable to resolve the routing for a particular alias because it has a
 *             terminal <code>RoutingStrategy</code> associated with it. The message returned in this
 *             exception is the message defined in the routing strategy itself. Such requests should
 *             only be retried if the routing strategy for the specified alias is modified. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link UnauthorizedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The client failed authentication. Clients should not retry such requests.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link GameLiftServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from GameLift service.</p>
