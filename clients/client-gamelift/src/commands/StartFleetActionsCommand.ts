/**
 * <p>Resumes certain types of activity on fleet instances that were suspended with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StopFleetActions.html">StopFleetActions</a>. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed
 *             separately for each location. Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet's
 *             auto-scaling activity.</p>
 *          <p>This operation can be used in the following ways: </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>To restart actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID
 *                     and the type of actions to resume. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>To restart actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations,
 *                     provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to resume. </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>If successful, Amazon GameLift once again initiates scaling events as triggered by the fleet's
 *             scaling policies. If actions on the fleet location were never stopped, this operation
 *             will have no effect.</p>

 * ```javascript

 * // const { GameLiftClient, StartFleetActionsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
 * const input = { // StartFleetActionsInput
 *   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   Actions: [ // FleetActionList // required
 *     "AUTO_SCALING",
 *   ],
 *   Location: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new StartFleetActionsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // StartFleetActionsOutput
 * //   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   FleetArn: "STRING_VALUE",
 * // };

 * ```
