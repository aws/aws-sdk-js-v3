 * <p>Deletes all resources and information related a fleet. Any current fleet instances,
 *             including those in remote locations, are shut down. You don't need to call
 *                 <code>DeleteFleetLocations</code> separately.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a
 *                 valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.html">CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization</a>. You do not need to explicitly delete the
 *                 VPC peering connection.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the deletion process
 *             the fleet status is changed to <code>DELETING</code>. When completed, the status
 *             switches to <code>TERMINATED</code> and the fleet event <code>FLEET_DELETED</code> is
 *             sent.</p>

 * ```javascript
 * import { GameLiftClient, DeleteFleetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GameLiftClient, DeleteFleetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteFleetInput
 *   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteFleetCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteFleetCommandInput - {@link DeleteFleetCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteFleetCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteFleetCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteFleetCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GameLiftClientResolvedConfig | config} for GameLiftClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServiceException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The service encountered an unrecoverable internal failure while processing the
 *             request. Clients can retry such requests immediately or after a waiting period.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidFleetStatusException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested operation would cause a conflict with the current state of a resource
 *             associated with the request and/or the fleet. Resolve the conflict before
 *             retrying.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>One or more parameter values in the request are invalid. Correct the invalid parameter
 *             values before retrying.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>THe requested resources was not found. The resource was either not created yet or deleted.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TaggingFailedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested tagging operation did not succeed. This may be due to invalid tag format
 *             or the maximum tag limit may have been exceeded. Resolve the issue before
 *             retrying.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link UnauthorizedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The client failed authentication. Clients should not retry such requests.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link GameLiftServiceException}
