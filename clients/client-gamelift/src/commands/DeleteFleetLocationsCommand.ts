/**
 * <p>Removes locations from a multi-location fleet. When deleting a location, all game
 *             server process and all instances that are still active in the location are shut down. </p>
 *          <p>To delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of the locations
 *             to be deleted. </p>
 *          <p>If successful, GameLift sets the location status to <code>DELETING</code>, and begins
 *             to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in each location being
 *             deleted. When completed, the location status changes to <code>TERMINATED</code>.</p>

 * // const { GameLiftClient, DeleteFleetLocationsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"); // CommonJS import
 * // See AWS SDK config options: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/configuring-the-jssdk.html
 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteFleetLocationsInput
 *   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   Locations: [ // LocationList // required
 *     "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ],
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteFleetLocationsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeleteFleetLocationsOutput
 * //   FleetId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   FleetArn: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   LocationStates: [ // LocationStateList
 * //     { // LocationState
 * //       Location: "STRING_VALUE",
