/**
 * <p>Removes locations from a multi-location fleet. When deleting a location, all game
 *             server process and all instances that are still active in the location are shut down. </p>
 *         <p>To delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of the locations
 *             to be deleted. </p>
 *         <p>If successful, GameLift sets the location status to <code>DELETING</code>, and begins
 *             to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in each location being
 *             deleted. When completed, the location status changes to <code>TERMINATED</code>.</p>
