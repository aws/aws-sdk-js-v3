/**
 * <p>
 *             <b>This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Locates an available game server and
 *             temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a
 *             game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a
 *             new game session. In response, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in
 *                 <code>CLAIMED</code> status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that
 *             players can use to connect to the game server. </p>
 *          <p>To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game
 *             server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally,
 *             include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a
 *             game map or player information. Add filter options to further restrict how a
 *             game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on <code>ACTIVE</code> instances
 *                 to be claimed.</p>
 *          <p>When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A
 *             claimed game server's utilization status remains <code>AVAILABLE</code> while the claim
 *             status is set to <code>CLAIMED</code> for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the
 *             game server time to update its status to <code>UTILIZED</code> after players join. If
 *             the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to
 *             unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time
 *             period is a fixed value and is not configurable.</p>
 *          <p>If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following
 *             cases:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the game server utilization status is <code>UTILIZED</code>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the game server claim status is <code>CLAIMED</code>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>If the game server is running on an instance in <code>DRAINING</code> status and
 *                 the provided filter option does not allow placing on <code>DRAINING</code> instances.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
