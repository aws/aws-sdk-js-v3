 * <fullname>Health</fullname>
 *          <p>The Health API provides access to the Health information that appears in the
 *             <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home">Health Dashboard</a>. You can use
 *          the API operations to get information about events that might affect your Amazon Web Services and resources.</p>
 *          <p>You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services Support</a> to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an
 *             Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a
 *             <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p>
 *          <p>For API access, you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use temporary
 *          credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary credentials include
 *          an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token that indicates when the
 *          credentials expire. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html">Best practices for managing
 *             Amazon Web Services access keys</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
 *          <p>You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the
 *          Health API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application architecture
 *          and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high
 *          availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web Services Region is active, so that you can
 *          get the latest information from the API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html">Accessing the Health
 *             API</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>For authentication of requests, Health uses the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing
 *             Process</a>.</p>
 *          <p>If your Amazon Web Services account is part of Organizations, you can use the Health organizational
 *          view feature. This feature provides a centralized view of Health events across all
 *          accounts in your organization. You can aggregate Health events in real time to
 *          identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get
 *          notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable
 *          this feature and return event information. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html">Aggregating
 *             Health events</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>When you use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the
 *             following recommendations:</p>
 *             <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode">eventScopeCode</a> parameter to specify whether to return Health
 *                   events that are public or account-specific.</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you call
 *                   the <code>DescribeEventsForOrganization</code> operation to get all events in your
 *                   organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the
 *                      <code>nextToken</code> in the next request to return more results.</p>
 *                </li>
 *             </ul>
 *          </note>
