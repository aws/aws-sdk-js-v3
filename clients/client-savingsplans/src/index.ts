 * <p>Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on Amazon Web Services usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a consistent
 *          amount of usage per hour, in the specified currency, for a term of one or three years, and
 *          receive a lower price for that usage. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/">Amazon Web Services
 *             Savings Plans User Guide</a>.</p>
