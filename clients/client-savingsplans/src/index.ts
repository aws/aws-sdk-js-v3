 * <p>Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on AWS usage (for

 *         per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and receive a lower price for that usage. For
 *         more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/">AWS Savings Plans User Guide</a>.</p>
