 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Registry</fullname>
 *          <p>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the
 *             familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR
 *             provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container
 *             Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based
 *             permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access
 *             repositories and images.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html">Amazon ECR endpoints</a> in the
 *                 <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
