/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified resource. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations-delete.html">Deleting a
 *         resource</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>After you have initiated a resource deletion request, you can monitor the progress of your
 *       request by calling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceRequestStatus.html">GetResourceRequestStatus</a> using the <code>RequestToken</code> of the
 *         <code>ProgressEvent</code> returned by <code>DeleteResource</code>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudControlClient, DeleteResourceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudcontrol"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudControlClient, DeleteResourceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudcontrol"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudControlClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteResourceInput
 *   TypeName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   TypeVersionId: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   RoleArn: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   ClientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   Identifier: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteResourceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeleteResourceOutput
 * //   ProgressEvent: { // ProgressEvent
 * //     TypeName: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     Identifier: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     RequestToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     Operation: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     OperationStatus: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     EventTime: new Date("TIMESTAMP"),
 * //     ResourceModel: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     StatusMessage: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     ErrorCode: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //     RetryAfter: new Date("TIMESTAMP"),
 * //   },
 * // };
 *
 * ```

 *
 * @throws {@link AlreadyExistsException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource with the name requested already exists.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ClientTokenConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified client token has already been used in another resource request.</p>
 *          <p>It's best practice for client tokens to be unique for each resource operation request.
 *       However, client token expire after 36 hours.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConcurrentOperationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Another resource operation is currently being performed on this resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link GeneralServiceException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that the downstream service generated an error that
 *       doesn't map to any other handler error code.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link HandlerFailureException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has failed without a returning a more specific error code. This can
 *       include timeouts.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link HandlerInternalFailureException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that an unexpected error occurred within the resource
 *       handler.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidCredentialsException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that the credentials provided by the user are
 *       invalid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that invalid input from the user has generated a generic
 *       exception.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NetworkFailureException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that the request couldn't be completed due to networking
 *       issues, such as a failure to receive a response from the server.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotStabilizedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that the downstream resource failed to complete all of
 *       its ready-state checks.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotUpdatableException} (client fault)
 *  <p>One or more properties included in this resource operation are defined as create-only, and
 *       therefore can't be updated.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PrivateTypeException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Cloud Control API hasn't received a valid response from the resource handler, due to a configuration
 *       error. This includes issues such as the resource handler returning an invalid response, or
 *       timing out.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource is temporarily unavailable to be acted upon. For example, if the resource is
 *       currently undergoing an operation and can't be acted upon until that operation is
 *       finished.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A resource with the specified identifier can't be found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceInternalErrorException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that the downstream service returned an internal error,
 *       typically with a <code>5XX HTTP</code> status code.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceLimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource handler has returned that a non-transient resource limit was reached on the
 *       service side.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to request throttling.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TypeNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified extension doesn't exist in the CloudFormation registry.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link UnsupportedActionException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The specified resource doesn't support this resource operation.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link CloudControlServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from CloudControl service.</p>
