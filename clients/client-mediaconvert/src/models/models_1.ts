When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren't moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes' faces, you might choose to set H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you enable temporal quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization). To manually enable or disable H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization, you must set Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to a value other than AUTO.

For numerically complex conversions, you can use interpolate (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence, use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost.
