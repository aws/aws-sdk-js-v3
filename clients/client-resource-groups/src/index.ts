/**
 * <p>Resource Groups lets you organize Amazon Web Services resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
 *             databases, and Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A
 *             resource group is a collection of resources that match the resource types specified in a
 *             query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of
 *             resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions,
 *             application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource Groups enable you to automate management
 *             tasks, such as those in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in
 *             Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console in
 *             Amazon Web Services Systems Manager that shows Config compliance and other monitoring data about member
 *             resources.</p>
 *          <p>To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that identify the
 *             criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are key-value pairs.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about Resource Groups, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html">Resource Groups User Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the following types of
 *             operations.</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and
 *                     resource query entities</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Resolving resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as search
 *                     results</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Getting data about resources that are members of a group</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Searching Amazon Web Services resources based on a resource query</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
