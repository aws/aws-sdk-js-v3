/**
 * <p>This public API operation provides a code that Amazon Cognito sent to your user when they
 *             signed up in your user pool via the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_SignUp.html">SignUp</a>
 *             API operation. After your user enters their code, they confirm ownership of the email
 *             address or phone number that they provided, and their user account becomes active.
 *             Depending on your user pool configuration, your users will receive their confirmation
 *             code in an email or SMS message.</p>
 *          <p>Local users who signed up in your user pool are the only type of user who can confirm
 *             sign-up with a code. Users who federate through an external identity provider (IdP) have
 *             already been confirmed by their IdP. Administrator-created users, users created with the
 *                 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminCreateUser.html">AdminCreateUser</a> API operation, confirm their accounts when they respond to
 *             their invitation email message and choose a password. They do not receive a confirmation
 *             code. Instead, they receive a temporary password.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For
 *     this operation, you can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't
 *     grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in
 *     Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html">Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints</a>.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CognitoIdentityProviderClient, ConfirmSignUpCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CognitoIdentityProviderClient, ConfirmSignUpCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CognitoIdentityProviderClient(config);
 * const input = { // ConfirmSignUpRequest
 *   ClientId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   SecretHash: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   Username: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ConfirmationCode: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ForceAliasCreation: true || false,
 *   AnalyticsMetadata: { // AnalyticsMetadataType

 *   UserContextData: { // UserContextDataType

 *     EncodedData: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   },
 *   ClientMetadata: { // ClientMetadataType
 *     "<keys>": "STRING_VALUE",
 *   },
 * };
 * const command = new ConfirmSignUpCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
