/**
 * <p>Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to any machine learning
 *       application. When an AI application can't evaluate data with a high degree of confidence,
 *       human reviewers can take over. This human review is called a human review workflow. To create
 *       and start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a <i>worker task
 *         template</i>, a <i>flow definition</i>, and a <i>human
 *         loop</i>.</p>
 *          <p>For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html">Get Started with
 *         Amazon Augmented AI</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>
 *          <p>This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that you can use
 *       to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Start a human loop with the <code>StartHumanLoop</code> operation when using
 *           Amazon A2I with a <i>custom task type</i>. To learn more about the
 *           difference between custom and built-in task types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html">Use Task Types </a>. To learn
 *           how to start a human loop using this API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-start-human-loop.html#a2i-instructions-starthumanloop">Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type </a> in the
 *           Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that you have created, describe
 *           individual human loops, and stop and delete human loops. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-monitor-humanloop-results.html">Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop </a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>Amazon A2I integrates APIs from various AWS services to create and start human review
 *       workflows for those services. To learn how Amazon A2I uses these APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-api-references.html">Use APIs in
 *         Amazon A2I</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>
