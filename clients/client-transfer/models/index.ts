   *       directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api call instead of s3 so you can use the put-object
   *       operation. For example, you use the following: <code>aws s3api put-object --bucket
   *         bucketname --key path/to/folder/</code>.  Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a
