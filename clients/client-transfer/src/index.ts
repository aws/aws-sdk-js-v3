/**
 * <p>Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File
 *       Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File
 *       Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon EFS.
 *       Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to transfer files into and out of Amazon S3.
 *       Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Transfer Family by integrating
 *       with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so
 *       nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in
 *       Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and
 *       archiving. Getting started with Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and
 *       set up.</p>
