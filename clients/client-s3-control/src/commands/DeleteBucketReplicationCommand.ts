/**
 * <note>
 *             <p>This operation deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To
 *             delete an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketReplication.html">DeleteBucketReplication</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 API Reference</i>. </p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>Deletes the replication configuration from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket.</p>
 *          <p>To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
 *             <code>s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration</code> action. The Outposts bucket owner
 *          has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about
 *          permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html">Setting up IAM with
 *             S3 on Outposts</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html">Managing access to
 *             S3 on Outposts buckets</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>It can take a while to propagate <code>PUT</code> or <code>DELETE</code> requests for
 *             a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication
 *             configuration that's returned by a <code>GET</code> request soon after a
 *                <code>PUT</code> or <code>DELETE</code> request might return a more recent result
 *             than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the
 *             replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of <code>x-amz-outpost-id</code> to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of <code>s3-control</code>. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the <code>x-amz-outpost-id</code> derived by using the access point ARN, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketReplication.html#API_control_DeleteBucketReplication_Examples">Examples</a> section.</p>
 *          <p>For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html">Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts</a> in the
 *             <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>
