/**
 * <p>Deletes the recovery point specified by a recovery point ID.</p>
 *          <p>If the recovery point ID belongs to a continuous backup, calling this endpoint deletes
 *          the existing continuous backup and stops future continuous backup.</p>
 *          <p>When an IAM role's permissions are insufficient to call this API, the service sends back
 *       an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body, but the recovery point is not deleted.
 *       Instead, it enters an <code>EXPIRED</code> state.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <code>EXPIRED</code> recovery points can be deleted with this API once the IAM role
 *       has the <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> action. To learn more about adding this role, see
 *       <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/deleting-backups.html#deleting-backups-troubleshooting">
 *          Troubleshooting manual deletions</a>.</p>
 *          <p>If the user or role is deleted or the permission within the role is removed,
 *       the deletion will not be successful and will enter an <code>EXPIRED</code> state.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { BackupClient, DeleteRecoveryPointCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-backup"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { BackupClient, DeleteRecoveryPointCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-backup"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new BackupClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteRecoveryPointInput
 *   BackupVaultName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   RecoveryPointArn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteRecoveryPointCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteRecoveryPointCommandInput - {@link DeleteRecoveryPointCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteRecoveryPointCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteRecoveryPointCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteRecoveryPointCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link BackupClientResolvedConfig | config} for BackupClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidParameterValueException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that something is wrong with a parameter's value. For example, the value is
 *          out of range.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that something is wrong with the input to the request. For example, a
 *          parameter is of the wrong type.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidResourceStateException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Backup is already performing an action on this recovery point. It can't
 *          perform the action you requested until the first action finishes. Try again later.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link MissingParameterValueException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that a required parameter is missing.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A resource that is required for the action doesn't exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceUnavailableException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The request failed due to a temporary failure of the server.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link BackupServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from Backup service.</p>
