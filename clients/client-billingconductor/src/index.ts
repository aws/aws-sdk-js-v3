/**
 * <p>Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that you can use to
 *       customize a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/understanding-eb.html#eb-other-definitions">proforma</a> version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback
 *       your end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change the way you're billed
 *       by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to
 *       configure, generate, and display rates to certain customers over a given billing period. You
 *       can also analyze the difference between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings
 *       relative to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon Web Services
 *       Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see the custom rate applied on the
 *       billing details page of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing">Amazon Web Services Billing
 *         console</a>, or configure a cost and usage report per billing group.</p>
 *          <p>This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor using its
 *       API. For more information about using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/">Amazon Web Services
 *         Billing Conductor</a> user interface, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/what-is-billingconductor.html"> Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor User Guide</a>.</p>
