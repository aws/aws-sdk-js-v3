/**
 * Deletes stored utterances.
 *
 * Amazon Lex stores the utterances that users send to your bot. Utterances are stored for 15 days for use with the GetUtterancesView operation, and then stored indefinitely for use in improving the ability of your bot to respond to user input.
 *
 * Use the `DeleteUtterances` operation to manually delete stored utterances for a specific user. When you use the `DeleteUtterances` operation, utterances stored for improving your bot's ability to respond to user input are deleted immediately. Utterances stored for use with the `GetUtterancesView` operation are deleted after 15 days.
 *
 * This operation requires permissions for the `lex:DeleteUtterances` action.
 *
 * @deprecated (since 2025-09-08) Amazon Lex V1 is deprecated. Use Amazon Lex V2 instead.
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LexModelBuildingServiceClient, DeleteUtterancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lex-model-building-service"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LexModelBuildingServiceClient, DeleteUtterancesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lex-model-building-service"); // CommonJS import
 * // import type { LexModelBuildingServiceClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-lex-model-building-service";
 * const config = {}; // type is LexModelBuildingServiceClientConfig
 * const client = new LexModelBuildingServiceClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteUtterancesRequest
 *   botName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   userId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteUtterancesCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteUtterancesCommandInput - {@link DeleteUtterancesCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteUtterancesCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteUtterancesCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteUtterancesCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LexModelBuildingServiceClientResolvedConfig | config} for LexModelBuildingServiceClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link BadRequestException} (client fault)
 *
 * The request is not well formed. For example, a value is invalid or a required field is missing. Check the field values, and try again.
 *

 *
 * An internal Amazon Lex error occurred. Try your request again.
 *
 * @throws {@link LimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *
 * The request exceeded a limit. Try your request again.
 *
