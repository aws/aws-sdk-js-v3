/**
 * <p>Deletes all versions of the bot, including the <code>$LATEST</code>
 *       version. To delete a specific version of the bot, use the <a>DeleteBotVersion</a> operation. The <code>DeleteBot</code>
 *       operation doesn't immediately remove the bot schema. Instead, it is marked
 *       for deletion and removed later.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon Lex stores utterances indefinitely for improving the ability of
 *       your bot to respond to user inputs. These utterances are not removed when
 *       the bot is deleted. To remove the utterances, use the <a>DeleteUtterances</a> operation.</p>
 *          <p>If a bot has an alias, you can't delete it. Instead, the
 *         <code>DeleteBot</code> operation returns a
 *         <code>ResourceInUseException</code> exception that includes a reference
 *       to the alias that refers to the bot. To remove the reference to the bot,
 *       delete the alias. If you get the same exception again, delete the
 *       referring alias until the <code>DeleteBot</code> operation is
 *       successful.</p>
 *          <p>This operation requires permissions for the
 *         <code>lex:DeleteBot</code> action.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LexModelBuildingServiceClient, DeleteBotCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lex-model-building-service"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LexModelBuildingServiceClient, DeleteBotCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lex-model-building-service"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LexModelBuildingServiceClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteBotRequest
 *   name: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteBotCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteBotCommandInput - {@link DeleteBotCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteBotCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteBotCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteBotCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LexModelBuildingServiceClientResolvedConfig | config} for LexModelBuildingServiceClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link BadRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request is not well formed. For example, a value is invalid or
 *       a required field is missing. Check the field values, and try
 *       again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p> There was a conflict processing the request. Try your request
 *       again. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalFailureException} (server fault)
 *  <p>An internal Amazon Lex error occurred. Try your request again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link LimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request exceeded a limit. Try your request again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource specified in the request was not found. Check the
 *       resource and try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceInUseException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource that you are attempting to delete is referred to by
 *       another resource. Use this information to remove references to the
 *       resource that you are trying to delete.</p>
 *          <p>The body of the exception contains a JSON object that describes the
 *       resource.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <code>{ "resourceType": BOT | BOTALIAS | BOTCHANNEL |
