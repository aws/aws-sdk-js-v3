/**
 * <p>Removes a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security Lake source. You
 *          can remove a source for one or more Regions. When you remove the source, Security Lake stops
 *          collecting data from that source in the specified Regions and accounts, and subscribers can
 *          no longer consume new data from the source. However, subscribers can still consume data
 *          that Security Lake collected from the source before removal.</p>
 *          <p>You can choose any source type in any Amazon Web Services Region for either accounts that
 *          are part of a trusted organization or standalone accounts. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SecurityLakeClient, DeleteAwsLogSourceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-securitylake"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SecurityLakeClient, DeleteAwsLogSourceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-securitylake"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SecurityLakeClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteAwsLogSourceRequest
 *   sources: [ // AwsLogSourceConfigurationList // required
 *     { // AwsLogSourceConfiguration
 *       accounts: [ // AccountList
 *         "STRING_VALUE",
 *       ],
 *       regions: [ // RegionList // required
 *         "STRING_VALUE",
 *       ],
 *       sourceName: "ROUTE53" || "VPC_FLOW" || "SH_FINDINGS" || "CLOUD_TRAIL_MGMT" || "LAMBDA_EXECUTION" || "S3_DATA" || "EKS_AUDIT" || "WAF", // required
 *       sourceVersion: "STRING_VALUE",
 *     },
 *   ],
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteAwsLogSourceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeleteAwsLogSourceResponse
 * //   failed: [ // AccountList
 * //     "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   ],
 * // };
 *
 * ```

 * @param DeleteAwsLogSourceCommandInput - {@link DeleteAwsLogSourceCommandInput}

 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient access to perform this action. Access denied errors appear when Amazon Security Lake explicitly or implicitly denies an authorization
 *          request. An explicit denial occurs when a policy contains a Deny statement for the specific
 *          Amazon Web Services action. An implicit denial occurs when there is no applicable Deny statement and also
 *          no applicable Allow statement.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link BadRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request is malformed or contains an error such as an invalid parameter value or a missing required parameter.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Occurs when a conflict with a previous successful write is detected. This generally
 *          occurs when the previous write did not have time to propagate to the host serving the
 *          current request. A retry (with appropriate backoff logic) is the recommended response to
 *          this exception.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>Internal service exceptions are sometimes caused by transient issues. Before you start
 *          troubleshooting, perform the operation again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource could not be found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The limit on the number of requests per second was exceeded.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link SecurityLakeServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from SecurityLake service.</p>
