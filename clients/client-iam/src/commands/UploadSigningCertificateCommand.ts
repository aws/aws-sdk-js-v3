/**
 * <p>Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified IAM user.
 *             Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates to validate requests that are signed
 *             with a corresponding private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is
 *                 <code>Active</code>.</p>
 *          <p>For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Managing
 *                 server certificates in IAM</a> in the
 *             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>If the <code>UserName</code> is not specified, the IAM user name is determined
 *             implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation
 *             works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation
 *             to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated
 *             users.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather
 *                 than GET when calling <code>UploadSigningCertificate</code>. For information about
 *                 setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing
 *                     Amazon Web Services API requests</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>. For
 *                 general information about using the Query API with IAM, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making query
 *                     requests</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, UploadSigningCertificateCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, UploadSigningCertificateCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const input = { // UploadSigningCertificateRequest
 *   UserName: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   CertificateBody: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new UploadSigningCertificateCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // UploadSigningCertificateResponse
 * //   Certificate: { // SigningCertificate
 * //     UserName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //     CertificateId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //     CertificateBody: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //     Status: "Active" || "Inactive", // required
 * //     UploadDate: new Date("TIMESTAMP"),
