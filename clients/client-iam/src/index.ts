 *          <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling
 *       access to Amazon Web Services services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials
 *       such as access keys, and permissions that control which Amazon Web Services resources users and
 *       applications can access. For more information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Identity and Access Management User Guide</a>.</p>
