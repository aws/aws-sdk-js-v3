/**
 * <p>Generates a report for service last accessed data for Organizations. You can generate a
 *             report for any entities (organization root, organizational unit, or account) or policies
 *             in your organization.</p>
 *         <p>To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations management account
 *             credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or
 *             temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your
 *             organization root. You must have the required IAM and Organizations permissions. For more
 *             information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Refining permissions using
 *                 service last accessed data</a> in the
 *             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only
 *             the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service
 *             control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity.</p>
 *         <p>You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an
 *             entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that
 *             are allowed by the specified SCP.</p>
 *         <p>For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account
 *             activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's
 *             children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions
 *             required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Reducing permissions using
 *                 service last accessed data</a> in the
 *             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <important>
 *             <p>The data includes all attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the successful ones. This
 *                 includes all attempts that were made using the Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any
 *                 of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service
 *                 last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the
 *                 request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative
 *                 source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or
 *                 denied access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html">Logging IAM events with
 *                     CloudTrail</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         </important>
 *         <p>This operation returns a <code>JobId</code>. Use this parameter in the <code>
 *                <a>GetOrganizationsAccessReport</a>
 *             </code> operation to check the status of
 *             the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the <code>JobId</code>
 *             parameter in the <code>
 *                <a>GetOrganizationsAccessReport</a>
 *             </code> operation
 *             and test the <code>JobStatus</code> response parameter. When the job is complete, you
 *             can retrieve the report.</p>
 *         <p>To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path
 *             without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify
 *             determines the data returned in the report.</p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>Root</b> – When you specify the

 *                     allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report
 *                     includes data for all accounts in your organization except the
 *                     management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>OU</b> – When you specify an
 *                     organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the
 *                     services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents. For each
 *                     service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children.
 *                     This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not
 *                     limited by SCPs.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>management account</b> – When you specify the
 *                     management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the
 *                     management account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the report includes
 *                     data for only the management account.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>Account</b> – When you specify another
 *                     account as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by
 *                     SCPs that are attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the
 *                     report includes data for only the specified account.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <p>To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path
 *             and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data
 *             returned for each service.</p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>Root</b> – When you specify the root
 *                     entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are
 *                     allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all
 *                     accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the
 *                     management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the
 *                     SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will
 *                     return a list of services with no data.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>OU</b> – When you specify an OU entity and
 *                     a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by
 *                     the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts
 *                     in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other
 *                     accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in
 *                     the data. This data excludes the management account, because the
 *                     management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU
 *                     or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no
 *                     data.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>management account</b> – When you specify the
 *                     management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the
 *                     management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI
 *                     or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for
 *                     only the management account.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <b>Account</b> – When you specify another
 *                     account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services
 *                     that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes
 *                     data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the
 *                     organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If
 *                     the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of
 *                     services with no data.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining
 *                 whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include
 *                 identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM
 *                 permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic.
 *                 For more about the evaluation of policy types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics">Evaluating policies</a> in the
