/**
 * <p>Returns a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file associated with the
 *       specified <code>JobId</code> value. You can access the manifest file for up to 60 minutes
 *       after this request has been made. To access the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed,
 *       you'll have to make another call to the <code>GetJobManifest</code> action.</p>
 *          <p>The manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job enters the
 *         <code>WithCustomer</code> status. This is the only valid status for calling this API as the
 *       manifest and <code>UnlockCode</code> code value are used for securing your device and should
 *       only be used when you have the device.  The manifest is decrypted by using the
 *         <code>UnlockCode</code> code value, when you pass both values to the Snow device through the
 *       Snowball client when the client is started for the first time. </p>
 *          <p>As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an
 *         <code>UnlockCode</code> value in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving
 *       these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snow device
 *       associated with that job.</p>
 *          <p>The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and unlock code, expire 360
 *       days after the job is created.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SnowballClient, GetJobManifestCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-snowball"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SnowballClient, GetJobManifestCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-snowball"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SnowballClient(config);
 * const input = { // GetJobManifestRequest
 *   JobId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new GetJobManifestCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // GetJobManifestResult
 * //   ManifestURI: "STRING_VALUE",
 * // };

 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidJobStateException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The action can't be performed because the job's current state doesn't allow that action
 *       to be performed.</p>
