/**
 * <p>Permanently deletes an Amazon GameLift Streams application resource. This also deletes the
 *             application content files stored with Amazon GameLift Streams. However, this does not delete the
 *             original files that you uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket; you can delete these any time
 *             after Amazon GameLift Streams creates an application, which is the only time Amazon GameLift Streams accesses your Amazon S3
 *             bucket.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             You can only delete an application that meets the following conditions:
 *         </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The application is in <code>READY</code> or <code>ERROR</code> status. You cannot delete an application that's in <code>PROCESSING</code> or <code>INITIALIZED</code> status.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The application is not the default application of any stream groups. You must first delete the stream group by using <a>DeleteStreamGroup</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The application is not linked to any stream groups. You must first unlink the stream group by using <a>DisassociateApplications</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                     An application is not streaming in any ongoing stream session. You must wait until the client ends the stream session or call <a>TerminateStreamSession</a> to end the stream.
 *                 </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>If any active stream groups exist for this application,
 *             this request returns a <code>ValidationException</code>.
 *         </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GameLiftStreamsClient, DeleteApplicationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-gameliftstreams"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GameLiftStreamsClient, DeleteApplicationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gameliftstreams"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GameLiftStreamsClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteApplicationInput
 *   Identifier: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteApplicationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteApplicationCommandInput - {@link DeleteApplicationCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteApplicationCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteApplicationCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteApplicationCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GameLiftStreamsClientResolvedConfig | config} for GameLiftStreamsClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You don't have the required permissions to access this Amazon GameLift Streams resource. Correct the
 *          permissions before you try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested operation would cause a conflict with the current state of a service resource associated with the request. Resolve the conflict before retrying this request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The service encountered an internal error and is unable to complete the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource specified in the request was not found. Correct the request before you try again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied due to request throttling. Retry the request after the
 *          suggested wait time.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>One or more parameter values in the request fail to satisfy the specified constraints.
 *          Correct the invalid parameter values before retrying the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link GameLiftStreamsServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from GameLiftStreams service.</p>
