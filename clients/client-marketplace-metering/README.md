## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript MarketplaceMetering Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname>

<p>This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering
Service API.</p>
<p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage
dimensions.</p>
<p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>MeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace
product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS
or ECS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<i>BatchMeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a set of
customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS)
application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Accepting New Customers</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>ResolveCustomer</i>- Called by a SaaS application during the
registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration
process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The
Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier
and Product Code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage
operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for
Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do
so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more
information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based Products</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to
verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for
records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit
records over time. For more information, see the <i>
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>
</i>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-marketplace-metering
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-marketplace-metering`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-marketplace-metering`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-marketplace-metering`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `MarketplaceMeteringClient` and
the commands you need, for example `BatchMeterUsageCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { MarketplaceMeteringClient, BatchMeterUsageCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-marketplace-metering");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { MarketplaceMeteringClient, BatchMeterUsageCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-marketplace-metering";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new MarketplaceMeteringClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new BatchMeterUsageCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-marketplace-metering";
const client = new AWS.MarketplaceMetering({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.batchMeterUsage(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .batchMeterUsage(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.batchMeterUsage(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
