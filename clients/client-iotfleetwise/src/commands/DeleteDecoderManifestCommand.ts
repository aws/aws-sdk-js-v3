 * <p> Deletes a decoder manifest. You can't delete a decoder manifest if it has vehicles

 *          <note>
 *             <p>If the decoder manifest is successfully deleted, Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise sends back an HTTP 200
 *                 response with an empty body.</p>

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IoTFleetWiseClient, DeleteDecoderManifestCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iotfleetwise"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IoTFleetWiseClient, DeleteDecoderManifestCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iotfleetwise"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IoTFleetWiseClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteDecoderManifestRequest
 *   name: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDecoderManifestCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeleteDecoderManifestResponse
 * //   name: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * //   arn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * // };
 *
 * ```

 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
