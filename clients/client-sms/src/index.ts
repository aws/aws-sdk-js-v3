 *             <p>We recommend <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service">Amazon Web Services Application Migration Service</a> (Amazon Web Services
 *                 MGN) as the primary migration service for lift-and-shift migrations. If Amazon Web Services MGN is
 *                 unavailable in a specific Amazon Web Services Region, you can use the Server Migration Service APIs through March
 *                 2023.</p>
