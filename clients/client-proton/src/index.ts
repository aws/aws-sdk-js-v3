 * <p>This is the Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax and usage examples for each of the
 *     <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">actions</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html">data types</a> for the Proton
 *    service.</p>
 *          <p>The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response.</p>
 *          <p>Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to access an API. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User
 *     Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>The Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide
 *    standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in
 *    turn, select from the available service templates to automate their application or service deployments.</p>
 *          <p>Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys and manages, they need
 *    permissions to use all of the listed API operations.</p>
 *          <p>When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton deploys their applications. To
 *    monitor their applications that are running on Proton, developers need permissions to the service
 *     <i>create</i>, <i>list</i>, <i>update</i> and <i>delete</i>
 *    API operations and the service instance <i>list</i> and <i>update</i> API
 *    operations.</p>

 *             <b>Ensuring Idempotency</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the asynchronous workflows
 *    of the operation are complete. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're
 *    complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the
 *    request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation
 *    completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation
 *    occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an
 *    idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete
 *    successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as
 *    the current creation status.</p>
 *          <p>The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Idempotent create APIs with a client token</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a <i>client token</i>. The
 *    corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique,
 *    case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions,
 *    specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you <i>don't</i> reuse the same client token
 *    for other API requests. If you donâ€™t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically
 *    provided by SDKs.</p>
 *          <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p>
 *          <p>If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without
 *    performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.</p>
 *          <p>If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry
 *    throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p>
 *          <p>Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new
 *    resource is created.</p>
 *          <p>If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created.</p>
 *          <p>Idempotent create APIs with a client token:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>CreateServiceTemplateVersion</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Idempotent create APIs</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p>
 *          <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource <i>hasn't</i> been
 *    modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail
 *    data in the response.</p>
 *          <p>If the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a <code>ConflictException</code>.</p>
 *          <p>If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an
 *     <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p>
 *          <p>Idempotent create APIs:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplate</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>CreateServiceTemplate</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>CreateEnvironment</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>CreateService</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Idempotent delete APIs</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p>
 *          <p>When you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its metadata is returned in
 *    the response.</p>
 *          <p>If you retry and the resource doesn't exist, the response is empty.</p>
 *          <p>In both cases, the retry succeeds.</p>
 *          <p>Idempotent delete APIs:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplate</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>DeleteServiceTemplate</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>DeleteServiceTemplateVersion</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs</b>
 *          </p>
 *          <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p>
 *          <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request delete operation status is
 *     <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, the retry returns the resource detail data in the response without performing any
 *    further actions.</p>
 *          <p>If the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty response.</p>
 *          <p>Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
