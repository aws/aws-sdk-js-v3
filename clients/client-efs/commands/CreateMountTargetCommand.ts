/**
 * <p>Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2
 *       instances by using the mount target.</p>
 *          <p>You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2
 *       instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target for a given
 *       file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target
 *       in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target
 *       in order to access their file system. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html">Amazon EFS: How it Works</a>. </p>
 *          <p>In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are creating the mount
 *       target and the file system's lifecycle state must be <code>available</code>. For more
 *       information, see <a>DescribeFileSystems</a>.</p>
 *          <p>In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target
 *           (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *
 *          <p>After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a
 *         <code>MountTargetId</code> and an <code>IpAddress</code>. You use this IP address when
 *       mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target's DNS name
 *       when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system by using
 *       the mount target can resolve the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more
 *       information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation">How it Works:
 *         Implementation Overview</a>. </p>
 *          <p>Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can
 *       be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or
 *       more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount
 *       target must meet the following requirements:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing
 *           mount targets</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *
 *          <p>If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:</p>
 *                <ul>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>If the request provides an <code>IpAddress</code>, Amazon EFS assigns that IP
 *               address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the
 *               subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 <code>CreateNetworkInterface</code> call
 *               does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>If the request provides <code>SecurityGroups</code>, this network interface is
 *               associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security
 *               group for the subnet's VPC.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Assigns the description <code>Mount target <i>fsmt-id</i> for
 *                 file system <i>fs-id</i>
 *                         </code> where <code>
 *                            <i>fsmt-id</i>
 *                         </code> is the mount target ID, and <code>
 *                            <i>fs-id</i>
 *                         </code> is the <code>FileSystemId</code>.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                   <li>
 *                      <p>Sets the <code>requesterManaged</code> property of the network interface to
 *                 <code>true</code>, and the <code>requesterId</code> value to
 *               <code>EFS</code>.</p>
 *                   </li>
 *                </ul>
 *                <p>Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network
 *           interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the
 *             <code>NetworkInterfaceId</code> field in the mount target's description to the
 *           network interface ID, and the <code>IpAddress</code> field to its address. If network
 *           interface creation fails, the entire <code>CreateMountTarget</code> operation
 *           fails.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>The <code>CreateMountTarget</code> call returns only after creating the network
 *         interface, but while the mount target state is still <code>creating</code>, you can check
 *         the mount target creation status by calling the <a>DescribeMountTargets</a> operation, which among other things returns the mount
 *         target state.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There
 *       are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target
 *       created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/efs/">Amazon EFS</a>. In addition, by always using a mount target local to the
 *       instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the
 *       Availability Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you can't access
 *       your file system through that mount target. </p>
 *          <p>This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file
 *       system:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget</code>
 *                </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>This operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2
 *       actions:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>ec2:DescribeSubnets</code>
 *                </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces</code>
 *                </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <code>ec2:CreateNetworkInterface</code>
 *                </p>
