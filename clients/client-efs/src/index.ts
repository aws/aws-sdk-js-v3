 *          <p>Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for
 *       use with Amazon EC2 Linux and Mac instances in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and
 *       remove files, so that your applications have the storage they need, when they need it. For
 *       more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html">Amazon Elastic File System API Reference</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html">Amazon Elastic File System User Guide</a>.</p>
