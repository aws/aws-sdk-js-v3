/**
 * <p>App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to
 *          monitor and control microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices
 *          communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high availability for
 *          your applications.</p>
 *          <p>App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for
 *          every microservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with Amazon Web Services Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services, and
 *             Amazon EC2.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discovery
 *             naming for their components. For more information about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service
 *                Discovery</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Kubernetes
 *                <code>kube-dns</code> and <code>coredns</code> are supported. For more information,
 *             see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/">DNS
 *                for Services and Pods</a> in the Kubernetes documentation.</p>
