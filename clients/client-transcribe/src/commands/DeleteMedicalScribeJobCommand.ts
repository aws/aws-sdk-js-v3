/**
 * <p>Deletes a Medical Scribe job. To use this operation, specify the name of the
 *             job you want to delete using <code>MedicalScribeJobName</code>. Job names are
 *             case sensitive.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { TranscribeClient, DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-transcribe"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { TranscribeClient, DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-transcribe"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new TranscribeClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteMedicalScribeJobRequest
 *   MedicalScribeJobName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommandInput - {@link DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteMedicalScribeJobCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link TranscribeClientResolvedConfig | config} for TranscribeClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link BadRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Your request didn't pass one or more validation tests. This can occur when the entity
 *             you're trying to delete doesn't exist or if it's in a non-terminal state (such as
 *                 <code>IN PROGRESS</code>). See the exception message field for more
 *             information.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalFailureException} (server fault)
 *  <p>There was an internal error. Check the error message, correct the issue, and try your
 *             request again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link LimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You've either sent too many requests or your input file is too long. Wait before
 *             retrying your request, or use a smaller file and try your request again.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TranscribeServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from Transcribe service.</p>
