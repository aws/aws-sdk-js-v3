## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript WorkMail Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for
existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and
calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or other native iOS and Android email
applications. You can integrate WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control
both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is
stored.</p>
<p>The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Listing and describing organizations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing users</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing groups</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing resources</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All WorkMail API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only
require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles
to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing
an IAM user to access the WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into
the entire WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not
limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This
allows developers to perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability
to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM model.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-workmail
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-workmail`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-workmail`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-workmail`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `WorkMailClient` and
the commands you need, for example `AssociateDelegateToResourceCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { WorkMailClient, AssociateDelegateToResourceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-workmail");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { WorkMailClient, AssociateDelegateToResourceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-workmail";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new WorkMailClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new AssociateDelegateToResourceCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-workmail";
const client = new AWS.WorkMail({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.associateDelegateToResource(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .associateDelegateToResource(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.associateDelegateToResource(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
