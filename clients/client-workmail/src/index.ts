/**
 * <p>WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for
 *          existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and
 *          calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or other native iOS and Android email
 *          applications. You can integrate WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control
 *          both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is
 *          stored.</p>
 *          <p>The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Listing and describing organizations</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Managing users</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Managing groups</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Managing resources</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>All WorkMail API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not
 *          only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management
 *          users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a
 *          role and allowing an IAM user to access the WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full
 *          administrative visibility into the entire WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM
 *          policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete
 *          users, groups, and resources. This allows developers to perform the scenarios listed above,
 *          as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM
 *          model.</p>
