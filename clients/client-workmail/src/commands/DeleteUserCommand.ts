/**
 * <p>Deletes a user from WorkMail and all subsequent systems. Before you can delete a
 *          user, the user state must be <code>DISABLED</code>. Use the <a>DescribeUser</a>
 *          action to confirm the user state.</p>
 *          <p>Deleting a user is permanent and cannot be undone. WorkMail archives user mailboxes for
 *          30 days before they are permanently removed.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { WorkMailClient, DeleteUserCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-workmail"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { WorkMailClient, DeleteUserCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-workmail"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new WorkMailClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteUserRequest
 *   OrganizationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   UserId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteUserCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteUserCommandInput - {@link DeleteUserCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteUserCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteUserCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteUserCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link WorkMailClientResolvedConfig | config} for WorkMailClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link DirectoryServiceAuthenticationFailedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The directory service doesn't recognize the credentials supplied by WorkMail.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link DirectoryUnavailableException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The directory is unavailable. It might be located in another Region or deleted.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link EntityStateException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You are performing an operation on a user, group, or resource that isn't in the
 *          expected state, such as trying to delete an active user.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidParameterException} (client fault)
 *  <p>One or more of the input parameters don't match the service's restrictions.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OrganizationNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>An operation received a valid organization identifier that either doesn't belong or
 *          exist in the system.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OrganizationStateException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The organization must have a valid state to perform certain
 *          operations on the organization or its members.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You can't perform a write operation against a read-only directory.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link WorkMailServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from WorkMail service.</p>
