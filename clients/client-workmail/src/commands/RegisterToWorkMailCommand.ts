/**
 * <p>Registers an existing and disabled user, group, or resource for WorkMail use by
 *          associating a mailbox and calendaring capabilities. It performs no change if the user,
 *          group, or resource is enabled and fails if the user, group, or resource is deleted. This
 *          operation results in the accumulation of costs. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/pricing">Pricing</a>. The equivalent console
 *          functionality for this operation is <i>Enable</i>.</p>
 *          <p>Users can either be created by calling the <a>CreateUser</a> API operation
 *          or they can be synchronized from your directory. For more information, see <a>DeregisterFromWorkMail</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { WorkMailClient, RegisterToWorkMailCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-workmail"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { WorkMailClient, RegisterToWorkMailCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-workmail"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new WorkMailClient(config);
 * const input = { // RegisterToWorkMailRequest
 *   OrganizationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   EntityId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   Email: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new RegisterToWorkMailCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
