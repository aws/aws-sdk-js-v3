 * <p>Attaches a resource-based policy to a private CA. </p>

 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services customer account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to
 * 			an Amazon Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information,
 * 			see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html">Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates
 * 			signed by a CA in another account.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates,
 * 			the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows
 * 			the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the
 * 			Amazon Web Services Private CA policy. For more information, see
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html">Using a
 *             Service Linked Role with ACM</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Updates made in Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information,
 * 			see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html">Attach a Policy for Cross-Account
 * 			Access</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ACMPCAClient, PutPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-acm-pca"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ACMPCAClient, PutPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-acm-pca"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ACMPCAClient(config);
 * const input = { // PutPolicyRequest
 *   ResourceArn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   Policy: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new PutPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param PutPolicyCommandInput - {@link PutPolicyCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link PutPolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link PutPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ACMPCAClientResolvedConfig | config} for ACMPCAClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ConcurrentModificationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A previous update to your private CA is still ongoing.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidArnException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested Amazon Resource Name (ARN) does not refer to an existing
 * 			resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidPolicyException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource policy is invalid or is missing a required statement. For general
 * 			information about IAM policy and statement structure, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json">Overview of JSON Policies</a>.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidStateException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The state of the private CA does not allow this action to occur.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link LockoutPreventedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The current action was prevented because it would lock the caller out from performing
 * 			subsequent actions. Verify that the specified parameters would not result in the caller
 * 			being denied access to the resource. </p>
 *
 * @throws {@link RequestFailedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request has failed for an unspecified reason.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>A resource such as a private CA, S3 bucket, certificate, audit report, or policy
 * 			cannot be found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ACMPCAServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from ACMPCA service.</p>
