/**
 * <p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy
 *             for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to setup or maintain your own
 *             Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment,
 *             scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you
 *             can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications
 *             running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any
 *             standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public
 *             clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.</p>
