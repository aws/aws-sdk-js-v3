/**
 * <p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy
 *             for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to stand up or maintain
 *             your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating
 *             the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. </p>
 *          <p>Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so
 *             you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community.
 *             Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications
 *             running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data
 *             centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes
 *             application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.</p>
