 * <fullname>Database Migration Service</fullname>
 *          <p>Database Migration Service (DMS) can migrate your data to and from the most
 *          widely used commercial and open-source databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL
 *          Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora, MySQL, and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise
 *          (ASE). The service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as
 *          heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to MySQL or
 *          SQL Server to PostgreSQL.</p>
 *          <p>For more information about DMS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html">What Is Database Migration Service?</a>
 *          in the <i>Database Migration Service User Guide.</i>
