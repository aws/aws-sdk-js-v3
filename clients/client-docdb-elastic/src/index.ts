 *       Amazon DocumentDB elastic clusters also simplify how developers interact with Amazon DocumentDB elastic-clusters by eliminating the need to choose, manage or upgrade instances.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon DocumentDB elastic-clusters were created to:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>provide a solution for customers looking for a database that provides virtually limitless scale with rich query capabilities and MongoDB API compatibility.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>give customers higher connection limits, and to reduce downtime from patching.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>continue investing in a cloud-native, elastic, and class leading architecture for JSON workloads.</p>
