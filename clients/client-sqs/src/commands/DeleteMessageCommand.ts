/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to
 *             delete, use the <code>ReceiptHandle</code> of the message (<i>not</i> the
 *                 <code>MessageId</code> which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can
 *             delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to
 *             be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue
 *             longer than the retention period configured for the queue. </p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>The <code>ReceiptHandle</code> is associated with a <i>specific
 *                     instance</i> of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than
 *                 once, the <code>ReceiptHandle</code> is different each time you receive a message.
 *                 When you use the <code>DeleteMessage</code> action, you must provide the most
 *                 recently received <code>ReceiptHandle</code> for the message (otherwise, the request
 *                 succeeds, but the message will not be deleted).</p>
 *             <p>For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you
 *                 delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a
 *                 copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message.
 *                 The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent
 *                 receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that
 *                 receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SQSClient, DeleteMessageCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sqs"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SQSClient, DeleteMessageCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sqs"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SQSClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteMessageRequest
 *   QueueUrl: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ReceiptHandle: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteMessageCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteMessageCommandInput - {@link DeleteMessageCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteMessageCommandOutput}
