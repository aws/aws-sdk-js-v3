## Description

<fullname>Amazon DynamoDB</fullname> <p>Amazon DynamoDB Streams provides API actions for accessing streams and processing stream records. To learn more about application development with Streams, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html">Capturing Table Activity with DynamoDB Streams</a> in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb-streams-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`DynamoDBStreamsClient`) and the commands you need, for example `DescribeStreamCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  DynamoDBStreamsClient,
  DescribeStreamCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb-streams-browser");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  DynamoDBStreamsClient,
  DescribeStreamCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb-streams-browser";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const dynamoDBStreams = new DynamoDBStreamsClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  StreamArn: /**a string value*/,
};
const describeStreamCommand = new DescribeStreamCommand(params);
dynamoDBStreams.send(describeStreamCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await dynamoDBStreams.send(describeStreamCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
dynamoDBStreams.send(describeStreamCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb-streams-browser";
const dynamoDBStreams = new AWS.DynamoDBStreams({ region: "region" });
dynamoDBStreams.describeStream(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await dynamoDBStreams.send(describeStreamCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
