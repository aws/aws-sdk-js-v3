## Description

<fullname>AWS Resource Groups</fullname> <p>AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, and Amazon S3 buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection of resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in AWS Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring data about member resources.</p> <p>To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that identify the criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are key-value pairs.</p> <p>For more information about Resource Groups, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS Resource Groups User Guide</a>.</p> <p>AWS Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the following types of operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and resource query entities</p> </li> <li> <p>Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups</p> </li> <li> <p>Resolving resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as search results</p> </li> <li> <p>Getting data about resources that are members of a group</p> </li> <li> <p>Searching AWS resources based on a resource query</p> </li> </ul>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-resource-groups-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`ResourceGroupsClient`) and the commands you need, for example `CreateGroupCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  ResourceGroupsClient,
  CreateGroupCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-resource-groups-browser");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  ResourceGroupsClient,
  CreateGroupCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-resource-groups-browser";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const resourceGroups = new ResourceGroupsClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  Name: /**a string value*/,
  ResourceQuery: { /**an object specifying ResourceQuery*/ },
};
const createGroupCommand = new CreateGroupCommand(params);
resourceGroups.send(createGroupCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await resourceGroups.send(createGroupCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
resourceGroups.send(createGroupCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-resource-groups-browser";
const resourceGroups = new AWS.ResourceGroups({ region: "region" });
resourceGroups.createGroup(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await resourceGroups.send(createGroupCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
