## Description

<fullname>AWS Shield Advanced</fullname> <p>This is the <i>AWS Shield Advanced API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the AWS Shield Advanced API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF and AWS Shield Advanced features and an overview of how to use the AWS WAF and AWS Shield Advanced APIs, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/">AWS WAF and AWS Shield Developer Guide</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-shield-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`ShieldClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AssociateDRTLogBucketCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  ShieldClient,
  AssociateDRTLogBucketCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-shield-browser");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  ShieldClient,
  AssociateDRTLogBucketCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-shield-browser";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const shield = new ShieldClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  LogBucket: /**a string value*/,
};
const associateDRTLogBucketCommand = new AssociateDRTLogBucketCommand(params);
shield.send(associateDRTLogBucketCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await shield.send(associateDRTLogBucketCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
shield.send(associateDRTLogBucketCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-shield-browser";
const shield = new AWS.Shield({ region: "region" });
shield.associateDRTLogBucket(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await shield.send(associateDRTLogBucketCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
