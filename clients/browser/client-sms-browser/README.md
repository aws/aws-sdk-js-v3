## Description

<fullname>AAWS Sever Migration Service</fullname> <p>This is the <i>AWS Sever Migration Service API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for the AWS Sever Migration Service (AWS SMS). The topic for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. You can also view the XML request elements in the WSDL.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.</p> <p>To learn more about the Server Migration Service, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/">AWS Sever Migration Service product page</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/latest/userguide/server-migration.html">AWS Sever Migration Service User Guide</a> </p> </li> </ul>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-sms-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`SMSClient`) and the commands you need, for example `CreateAppCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const { SMSClient, CreateAppCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sms-browser");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import { SMSClient, CreateAppCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sms-browser";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const sMS = new SMSClient({ region: "region" });
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {};
const createAppCommand = new CreateAppCommand(params);
sMS
  .send(createAppCommand)
  .then(data => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // error handling
  });
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await sMS.send(createAppCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
sMS.send(createAppCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-sms-browser";
const sMS = new AWS.SMS({ region: "region" });
sMS.createApp(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await sMS.send(createAppCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
