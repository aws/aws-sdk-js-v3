## Description

<p>Amazon Comprehend is an AWS service for gaining insight into the content of documents. Use these actions to determine the topics contained in your documents, the topics they discuss, the predominant sentiment expressed in them, the predominant language used, and more.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-comprehend-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`ComprehendClient`) and the commands you need, for example `BatchDetectDominantLanguageCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  ComprehendClient,
  BatchDetectDominantLanguageCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-comprehend-browser");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  ComprehendClient,
  BatchDetectDominantLanguageCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-comprehend-browser";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const comprehend = new ComprehendClient({ region: "region" });
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  TextList: [
    /**a list of string*/
  ]
};
const batchDetectDominantLanguageCommand = new BatchDetectDominantLanguageCommand(
  params
);
comprehend
  .send(batchDetectDominantLanguageCommand)
  .then(data => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // error handling
  });
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await comprehend.send(batchDetectDominantLanguageCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
comprehend.send(batchDetectDominantLanguageCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-comprehend-browser";
const comprehend = new AWS.Comprehend({ region: "region" });
comprehend.batchDetectDominantLanguage(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await comprehend.send(batchDetectDominantLanguageCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
