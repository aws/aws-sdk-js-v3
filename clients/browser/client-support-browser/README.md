## Description

<fullname>AWS Support</fullname> <p>The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.</p> <p>The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">Trusted Advisor</a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. </p> <p>The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. </b>The <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase</a> operation. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Case creation, case details, and case resolution.</b> The <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>, <a>DescribeAttachment</a>, and <a>ResolveCase</a> operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Case communication.</b> The <a>DescribeCommunications</a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a>, and <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a> operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases. </p> </li> </ul> <p>The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a> returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the <code>checkId</code> for a specific check returned by <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a>, you can call <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult</a> to obtain the results for the check you specified.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries</a> returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck</a> requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses</a> reports the refresh status of one or more checks. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html">About the AWS Support API</a> in the <i>AWS Support User Guide</i> for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources. </p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-support-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`SupportClient`) and the commands you need, for example `AddAttachmentsToSetCommand`:

```javascript
//JavaScript
const {
  SupportClient,
  AddAttachmentsToSetCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-support-browser");
```

```javascript
//TypeScript
import {
  SupportClient,
  AddAttachmentsToSetCommand
} from "@aws-sdk/client-support-browser";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const support = new SupportClient({ region: "region" });
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
  attachments: [
    /**a list of structure*/
  ]
};
const addAttachmentsToSetCommand = new AddAttachmentsToSetCommand(params);
support
  .send(addAttachmentsToSetCommand)
  .then(data => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // error handling
  });
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await support.send(addAttachmentsToSetCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
support.send(addAttachmentsToSetCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-support-browser";
const support = new AWS.Support({ region: "region" });
support.addAttachmentsToSet(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await support.send(addAttachmentsToSetCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
