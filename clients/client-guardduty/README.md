## Description

AWS SDK for JavaScript GuardDuty Client for Node.js, Browser and React Native.

<p>Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes
the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. It uses
threat intelligence feeds (such as lists of malicious IPs and domains) and machine learning to
identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your AWS
environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed
credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can
detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin. </p>
<p>GuardDuty also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise. Some examples
of this are unauthorized infrastructure deployments such as EC2 instances deployed in a Region
that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce
password strength. </p>
<p>GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS environment by producing security findings
that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more
information, see the <i>
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html">Amazon
GuardDuty User Guide</a>
</i>. </p>

## Installing

To install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-guardduty
using your favorite package manager:

- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-guardduty`
- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-guardduty`
- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-guardduty`

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.
To send a request, you only need to import the `GuardDutyClient` and
the commands you need, for example `AcceptInvitationCommand`:

```js
// ES5 example
const { GuardDutyClient, AcceptInvitationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-guardduty");
```

```ts
// ES6+ example
import { GuardDutyClient, AcceptInvitationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-guardduty";
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```js
// a client can be shared by difference commands.
const client = new GuardDutyClient({ region: "REGION" });

const params = {
  /** input parameters */
};
const command = new AcceptInvitationCommand(params);
```

#### Async/await

We recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
operator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:

```js
// async/await.
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
} finally {
  // finally.
}
```

Async-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling
as compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.

#### Promises

You can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)
to execute send operation.

```js
client.send(command).then(
  (data) => {
    // process data.
  },
  (error) => {
    // error handling.
  }
);
```

Promises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:

```js
client
  .send(command)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // finally.
  });
```

#### Callbacks

We do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),
but they are supported by the send operation.

```js
// callbacks.
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

#### v2 compatible style

The client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.
However, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post
on [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

```ts
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/client-guardduty";
const client = new AWS.GuardDuty({ region: "REGION" });

// async/await.
try {
  const data = client.acceptInvitation(params);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  // error handling.
}

// Promises.
client
  .acceptInvitation(params)
  .then((data) => {
    // process data.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // error handling.
  });

// callbacks.
client.acceptInvitation(params, (err, data) => {
  // proccess err and data.
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,
as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```js
try {
  const data = await client.send(command);
  // process data.
} catch (error) {
  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;
  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });
  /**
   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.
   * You can access them by specifying exception names:
   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;
   * }
   */
}
```
