This package provides a presigner based on signature V4 that will attempt to
generate signed url for S3.

### Get Presigned URL with Client and Command

You can generated presigned url from S3 client and command. Here's the example:

JavaScript Example:

```javascript
const { getSignedUrl } = require("@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner");
const { S3Client, GetObjectCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");
const client = new S3Client(clientParams);
const command = new GetObjectCommand(getObjectParams);
const url = await getSignedUrl(client, command, { expiresIn: 3600 });
```

ES6 Example

```javascript
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { S3Client, GetObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
const client = new S3Client(clientParams);
const command = new GetObjectCommand(getObjectParams);
const url = await getSignedUrl(client, command, { expiresIn: 3600 });
```

You can get signed URL for other S3 operations too, like `PutObjectCommand`.
`expiresIn` config from the examples above is optional. If not set, it's default
at `900`.

If your request contains server-side encryption(`SSE*`) configurations, because
of S3 limitation, you need to send corresponding headers along with the
presigned url. For more information, please go to [S3 SSE reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/KMSUsingRESTAPI.html)

If you already have a request, you can pre-sign the request following the
section bellow.

### Get Presigned URL from an Existing Request

JavaScript Example:

```javascript
const { S3RequestPresigner } = require("@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner");
const { Sha256 } = require("@aws-crypto/sha256-browser");
const { Hash } = require("@smithy/hash-node");
const signer = new S3RequestPresigner({
  region: regionProvider,
  credentials: credentialsProvider,
  sha256: Hash.bind(null, "sha256"), // In Node.js
  //sha256: Sha256 // In browsers
});
const presigned = await signer.presign(request);
```

ES6 Example:

```javascript
import { S3RequestPresigner } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { Sha256 } from "@aws-crypto/sha256-browser";
import { Hash } from "@aws-sdk/hash-node";
const signer = new S3RequestPresigner({
  region: regionProvider,
  credentials: credentialsProvider,
  sha256: Hash.bind(null, "sha256"), // In Node.js
  //sha256: Sha256 // In browsers
});
const presigned = await signer.presign(request);
```

To avoid redundant construction parameters when instantiating the s3 presigner,
you can simply spread the configuration of an existing s3 client and supply it to
the presigner's constructor.

```javascript
//s3 is instantiated from S3Client from @aws-sdk/client-s3-* packages
const signer = new S3RequestPresigner({
  ...s3.config,
});
```

If your request contains server-side encryption(`x-amz-server-side-encryption*`)
headers, because of S3 limitation, you need to send these headers along
with the presigned url. That is to say, the url only from calling `formatUrl()`
to `presigned` is not sufficient to make a request. You need to send the
server-side encryption headers along with the url. These headers remain in the
`presigned.headers`
