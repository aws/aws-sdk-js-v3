# @aws-sdk/client-s3-browser

## Description

Amazon Simple Storage Service service

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window: 

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`S3Client`) and the commands you need, for example `PutObjectCommand`:

```javascript
//javascript
const { S3Client } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3-browser/S3Client');
const { PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3-browser/commands/PutObjectCommand');
```

```javascript
//typescript
const { S3Client } = import '@aws-sdk/client-s3-browser/S3Client';
const { PutObjectCommand } = import '@aws-sdk/client-s3-browser/commands/PutObjectCommand';
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

* Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
* Initiate command with input parameters.
* Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
* If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections. 

```javascript
const s3 = new S3Client({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
    Body: /**a blob value*/
    /**You can supply readable stream to streaming input. e.g. (await fetch(input)).body */,
    Bucket: /**a string value*/,
    Key: /**a string value*/,
};
const putObjectCommand = new PutObjectCommand(params);
s3.send(putObjectCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
    const data = await s3.send(putObjectCommand);
    // do something
} catch(error) {
    // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
s3.send(putObjectCommand, (err, data) => {
    //do something
})
```
 
The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from '@aws-sdk/@aws-sdk/client-s3-browser/S3';
const s3 = new AWS.S3({region: 'region'})
s3.putObject(params, (err, data) => {
    //do something
})

```

For operations containing stream response like `GetObject()`, you can get response stream by accessing to streaming member. e.g. data.Body.getReader().read().then(/* do something and continue reading */).(`data` is the resolved response object)

### Troubleshooting 

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
    const data = await s3.send(putObjectCommand);
    // do something
} catch(error) {
    const metadata = error.$metadata;
    console.log(
`requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
    );
/*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
