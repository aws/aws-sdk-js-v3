Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets.

When you add a <code>HealthCheckId</code> element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check. </p> </important> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy. </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets (example.com).</p> <important> <p>n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> matches the name of the resource record sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.</p> </important> <p>For more information, see the following topics in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html">Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html">Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone</a> </p> </li> </ul>
