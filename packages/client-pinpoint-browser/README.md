# @aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-browser

## Description

Amazon Pinpoint

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window: 

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`PinpointClient`) and the commands you need, for example `CreateAppCommand`:

```javascript
//javascript
const { PinpointClient } = require('@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-browser/PinpointClient');
const { CreateAppCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-browser/commands/CreateAppCommand');
```

```javascript
//typescript
const { PinpointClient } = import '@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-browser/PinpointClient';
const { CreateAppCommand } = import '@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-browser/commands/CreateAppCommand';
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

* Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
* Initiate command with input parameters.
* Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
* If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections. 

```javascript
const pinpoint = new PinpointClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
    CreateApplicationRequest: { /**an object specifying CreateApplicationRequest*/ },
};
const createAppCommand = new CreateAppCommand(params);
pinpoint.send(createAppCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
    const data = await pinpoint.send(createAppCommand);
    // do something
} catch(error) {
    // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
pinpoint.send(createAppCommand, (err, data) => {
    //do something
})
```
 
The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from '@aws-sdk/@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-browser/Pinpoint';
const pinpoint = new AWS.Pinpoint({region: 'region'})
pinpoint.createApp(params, (err, data) => {
    //do something
})

```

### Troubleshooting 

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
    const data = await pinpoint.send(createAppCommand);
    // do something
} catch(error) {
    const metadata = error.$metadata;
    console.log(
`requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
    );
/*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
