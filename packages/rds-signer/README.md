import { Signer } from "@aws-sdk/rds-signer";
```

Or CommonJS import

### Generate Authentication Token for RDS IAM Authentication

```js
const signer = new Signer({
  /**
   * Required. The hostname of the database to connect to.
   */
  hostname: "db.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
  /**
   * Required. The port number the database is listening on.
   */
  port: 8000,
  /**
   * Required. The username to login as.
   */
  username: "user1",
  /**
   * Optional. The AWS credentials to sign requests with. Uses the default credential provider chain in not specified.
   */
  credentials: fromNodeCredentialProvider(),
  /**
   * Optional. The region the database is located in. Uses the region inferred from the runtime if omitted.
   */
  region: "us-east-1",
  /**
   * Optional. The SHA256 hasher constructor to sign the request.
   */
  sha256: HashCtor,
});

const token = await signer.getAuthToken();
// Use this token as the password for connecting to your RDS instance
