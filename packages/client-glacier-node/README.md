## Description

<p>Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for "cold data."</p> <p>Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.</p> <p>Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>.</p> <p>You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.</p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the <i>Amazon Glacier Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html">What is Amazon Glacier</a> - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html">Getting Started with Amazon Glacier</a> - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.</p> </li> </ul>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window: 

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-glacier-node
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`GlacierClient`) and the commands you need, for example `UploadArchiveCommand`:

```javascript
//javascript
const { GlacierClient } = require('@aws-sdk/client-glacier-node/GlacierClient');
const { UploadArchiveCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-glacier-node/commands/UploadArchiveCommand');
```

```javascript
//typescript
const { GlacierClient } = import '@aws-sdk/client-glacier-node/GlacierClient';
const { UploadArchiveCommand } = import '@aws-sdk/client-glacier-node/commands/UploadArchiveCommand';
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

* Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
* Initiate command with input parameters.
* Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
* If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections. 

```javascript
const glacier = new GlacierClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
    vaultName: /**a string value*/,
    accountId: /**a string value*/,
    body: /**a blob value*/
    /**You can supply readable stream to streaming input. e.g. fs.createReadStream(file) */,
};
const uploadArchiveCommand = new UploadArchiveCommand(params);
glacier.send(uploadArchiveCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
    const data = await glacier.send(uploadArchiveCommand);
    // do something
} catch(error) {
    // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
glacier.send(uploadArchiveCommand, (err, data) => {
    //do something
})
```
 
The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from '@aws-sdk/@aws-sdk/client-glacier-node/Glacier';
const glacier = new AWS.Glacier({region: 'region'})
glacier.uploadArchive(params, (err, data) => {
    //do something
})

```

For operations containing stream response like `GetJobOutput()`, you can get response stream by accessing to streaming member. e.g. data.body.pipe(/* some writable stream */).(`data` is the resolved response object)

### Troubleshooting 

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
    const data = await glacier.send(uploadArchiveCommand);
    // do something
} catch(error) {
    const metadata = error.$metadata;
    console.log(
`requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
    );
/*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
