# @aws-sdk/nested-clients

## Description

This is an internal package. Do not install this as a direct dependency.

This package contains separate internal implementations of the STS and SSO-OIDC AWS SDK clients
to be used by the AWS SDK credential providers to break a cyclic dependency.

### Bundlers

This package may be marked as external if you do not use STS nor SSO-OIDC
in your credential resolution process.
