# AWS Signature V4 Signer for Node.JS

This module provides a class, `SignatureV4`, that will attempt to sign requests.

## Supported configuration

The Signature V4 Signer requires several options to be set, and additionally has several optional configuration settings.
You may provide these options in a hash to the `SignatureV4` constructor.
The following options are supported:

  * `service` - The service signing name to use.
  * `region` - The region name or a function that returns a promise 
  that will be resolved with the region name.
  * `credentials` - The credentials with which the request should be
  signed, or a function that returns a promise that will be resolved
  with credentials
  * `sha256` - Optional. A constructor function for a hash object that
  will calculate SHA-256 HMAC checksums.
  Defaults to an implementation using Node.JS' `crypto` module.
  * `unsignedPayload` - Optional. Indicates whether to sign requests
  in such a way as to allow arbitrary message bodies.
  Useful for presigning requests for which the body is not known in advance.
  Defaults to false.
  * `uriEscapePath` - Optional. Indicates whether to uri-escape the
  request URI path as part of computing the canonical request string.
  This is required for every AWS service, except Amazon S3, as of
  late 2017.
  Defaults to true.
  * `applyChecksum` - Optional. Indicates whether to calculate a
  checksum of the request body and include it as either a request
  header (when signing) or as a query string parameter (when presigning).
  This is required for AWS Glacier and optional for every other AWS
  service as of late 2017.
  Defaults to false.

## API

### presignRequest
The `presignRequest` method accepts a request and returns a Promise that
resolves with a presigned request. The presigned request will have an
expiration and can be passed directly to an HTTP client. The following options can be provided within a hash to the `presignRequest` method:

  * `request` - The request to be signed. This parameter will not be
  modified during the signing process but will instead be cloned.
  The shape of the request should be an object with the following defined:
    * `method` - HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'PUT', etc).
    * `headers` - A mapping of header names to string values.
    Multiple values for the same header should be represented as a single
    string with values separated by `, `.
    Keys should be considered case insensitive.
    * `body` - Optional. May be a string, ArrayBuffer, or stream.
  * `signingDate` - Optional. The date and time to be used as signature metadata.
  This value should be a Date object, a unix (epoch) timestamp, or
  a string that can be unerstood by the JavaScript `Date` constructor.
  Defaults to `new Date()`.
  * `expiration` - The time at which the signed URL should no longer
  be honored.
  This value should be a Date object, a unix (epoch) timestamp, or a
  string that can be understood by the JavaScript `Date` constructor.
  * `hoistHeaders` - Optional. Indicates whether to move all values that
  would normally be sent as headers to the query string of the URL.
  This allows the returned value to be used in contexts that do not
  permit specifying additional headers, such as `<img>` tags or `<a>` links.
  If set to false, then the request must be sent along with the headers
  with which it was signed.
  Defaults to true.
  * `unsignableHeaders` - Optional. An object whose keys represents
  headers that cannot be signed. All headers in the provided request
  will have their names converted to lower case and then checked for
  existence in the `unsignableHeaders` object using the `in` operator.
  Defaults to an object whose keys are lower-cased transfer-specific
  headers (such as `user-agent`, `referer`, `expect`, etc).
  * `unsignedPayload` - Optional. Indicates whether to sign requests
  in such a way as to allow arbitrary message bodies.
  Useful for presigning requests for which the body is not known in advance.
  Defaults to value passed into constructor.

### signRequest
The `signRequest` method accepts a request and returns a Promise that
resolves with a signed request. The signed request will have an
expiration and can be passed directly to an HTTP client. The following options can be provided within a hash to the `signRequest` method:

  * `request` - The request to be signed. This parameter will not be
  modified during the signing process but will instead be cloned.
  The shape of the request should be an object with the following defined:
    * `method` - HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'PUT', etc).
    * `headers` - A mapping of header names to string values.
    Multiple values for the same header should be represented as a single
    string with values separated by `, `.
    Keys should be considered case insensitive.
    * `body` - Optional. May be a string, ArrayBuffer, or stream.
  * `signingDate` - Optional. The date and time to be used as signature metadata.
  This value should be a Date object, a unix (epoch) timestamp, or
  a string that can be unerstood by the JavaScript `Date` constructor.
  Defaults to `new Date()`.
  * `unsignableHeaders` - Optional. An object whose keys represents
  headers that cannot be signed. All headers in the provided request
  will have their names converted to lower case and then checked for
  existence in the `unsignableHeaders` object using the `in` operator.
  Defaults to an object whose keys are lower-cased transfer-specific
  headers (such as `user-agent`, `referer`, `expect`, etc).
  * `unsignedPayload` - Optional. Indicates whether to sign requests
  in such a way as to allow arbitrary message bodies.
  Useful for presigning requests for which the body is not known in advance.
  Defaults to value passed into constructor.
