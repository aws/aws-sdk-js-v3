For more information, refer to the scenario in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam">Default Key Policy</a> section of the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy. The reason for this is that the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency">Changes that I make are not always immediately visible</a> in the <i>AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The key policy size limit is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).</p>
