   * <p>The key policy to attach to the CMK.</p> <p>If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you don't set <code>BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck</code> to true, the key policy must allow the principal that is making the <code>CreateKey</code> request to make a subsequent <a>PutKeyPolicy</a> request on the CMK. This reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam">Default Key Policy</a> section of the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy. The reason for this is that the new principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS.
