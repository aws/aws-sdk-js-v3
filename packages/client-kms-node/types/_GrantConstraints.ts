For more information about encryption context, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encryption-context.html">Encryption Context</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Grant constraints apply only to operations that accept encryption context as input. For example, the <code> <a>DescribeKey</a> </code> operation does not accept encryption context as input. A grant that allows the <code>DescribeKey</code> operation does so regardless of the grant constraints. In contrast, the <code> <a>Encrypt</a> </code> operation accepts encryption context as input. A grant that allows the <code>Encrypt</code> operation does so only when the encryption context of the <code>Encrypt</code> operation satisfies the grant constraints.</p>
