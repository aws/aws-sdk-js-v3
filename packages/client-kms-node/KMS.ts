You must also specify the length of the data key using either the <code>KeySpec</code> or <code>NumberOfBytes</code> field. You must specify one field or the other, but not both. For common key lengths (128-bit and 256-bit symmetric keys), we recommend that you use <code>KeySpec</code>. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.</p> <p>This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key in the <code>Plaintext</code> field of the response, and an encrypted copy of the data key in the <code>CiphertextBlob</code> field. The data key is encrypted under the CMK specified in the <code>KeyId</code> field of the request. </p> <p>We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use this operation (<code>GenerateDataKey</code>) to get a data encryption key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the <code>Plaintext</code> field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Store the encrypted data key (returned in the <code>CiphertextBlob</code> field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To decrypt data locally:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use the <a>Decrypt</a> operation to decrypt the encrypted data key into a plaintext copy of the data key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To return only an encrypted copy of the data key, use <a>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</a>. To return a random byte string that is cryptographically secure, use <a>GenerateRandom</a>.</p> <p>If you use the optional <code>EncryptionContext</code> field, you must store at least enough information to be able to reconstruct the full encryption context when you later send the ciphertext to the <a>Decrypt</a> operation. It is a good practice to choose an encryption context that you can reconstruct on the fly to better secure the ciphertext.
