     * - build: The input has been serialized into an HTTP request, but that

     *      will be applied to all retries. Examples of typical build tasks
     *      include injecting HTTP headers that describe a stable aspect of the
     *      request, such as `Content-Length` or a body checksum.
     * - finalize: The request is being prepared to be sent over the wire. The
     *      request in this stage should already be semantically complete and
     *      should therefore only be altered as match the recipient's
     *      expectations. Examples of typical finalization tasks include request
     *      signing and injecting hop-by-hop headers.

     *      per operation execution, finalization handlers will be executed for
     *      each HTTP request sent.
