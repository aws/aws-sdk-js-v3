## Description

<fullname>Amazon Cognito</fullname> <p>Amazon Cognito is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. Amazon Cognito uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>Using Amazon Cognito, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon), and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.</p> <p>To provide end-user credentials, first make an unsigned call to <a>GetId</a>. If the end user is authenticated with one of the supported identity providers, set the <code>Logins</code> map with the identity provider token. <code>GetId</code> returns a unique identifier for the user.</p> <p>Next, make an unsigned call to <a>GetCredentialsForIdentity</a>. This call expects the same <code>Logins</code> map as the <code>GetId</code> call, as well as the <code>IdentityID</code> originally returned by <code>GetId</code>. Assuming your identity pool has been configured via the <a>SetIdentityPoolRoles</a> operation, <code>GetCredentialsForIdentity</code> will return AWS credentials for your use. If your pool has not been configured with <code>SetIdentityPoolRoles</code>, or if you want to follow legacy flow, make an unsigned call to <a>GetOpenIdToken</a>, which returns the OpenID token necessary to call STS and retrieve AWS credentials. This call expects the same <code>Logins</code> map as the <code>GetId</code> call, as well as the <code>IdentityID</code> originally returned by <code>GetId</code>. The token returned by <code>GetOpenIdToken</code> can be passed to the STS operation <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html">AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a> to retrieve AWS credentials.</p> <p>If you want to use Amazon Cognito in an Android, iOS, or Unity application, you will probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/index.html">AWS Mobile SDK Developer Guide</a>.</p>

## Installing

To install the this package using NPM, simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-browser
```

## Getting Started

### Import

The AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands in CommonJS modules. To send a request, you only need to import the client(`CognitoIdentityClient`) and the commands you need, for example `CreateIdentityPoolCommand`:

```javascript
//javascript
const {
  CognitoIdentityClient
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-browser/CognitoIdentityClient");
const {
  CreateIdentityPoolCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-browser/commands/CreateIdentityPoolCommand");
```

```javascript
//typescript
const { CognitoIdentityClient } = import '@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-browser/CognitoIdentityClient';
const { CreateIdentityPoolCommand } = import '@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-browser/commands/CreateIdentityPoolCommand';
```

### Usage

To send a request, you:

- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region). For more information you can refer to the [API reference][].
- Initiate command with input parameters.
- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.
- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.

```javascript
const cognitoIdentity = new CognitoIdentityClient({region: 'region'});
//clients can be shared by different commands
const params = {
    IdentityPoolName: /**a string value*/,
    AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities: /**a boolean value*/,
};
const createIdentityPoolCommand = new CreateIdentityPoolCommand(params);
cognitoIdentity.send(createIdentityPoolCommand).then(data => {
    // do something
}).catch(error => {
    // error handling
})
```

In addition to using promises, there are 2 other ways to send a request:

```javascript
// async/await
try {
  const data = await cognitoIdentity.send(createIdentityPoolCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

```javascript
// callback
cognitoIdentity.send(createIdentityPoolCommand, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

The SDK can also send requests using the simplified callback style from version 2 of the SDK.

```javascript
import * as AWS from "@aws-sdk/@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-browser/CognitoIdentity";
const cognitoIdentity = new AWS.CognitoIdentity({ region: "region" });
cognitoIdentity.createIdentityPool(params, (err, data) => {
  //do something
});
```

### Troubleshooting

When the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information, as well as response metadata (e.g. request id).

```javascript
try {
  const data = await cognitoIdentity.send(createIdentityPoolCommand);
  // do something
} catch (error) {
  const metadata = error.$metadata;
  console.log(
    `requestId: ${metadata.requestId}
cfId: ${metadata.cfId}
extendedRequestId: ${metadata.extendedRequestId}`
  );
  /*
The keys within exceptions are also parsed. You can access them by specifying exception names:
    if(error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {
        const value = error.specialKeyInException;
    }
*/
}
```
