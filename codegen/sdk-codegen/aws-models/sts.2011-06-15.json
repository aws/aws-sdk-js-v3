The administrator must attach a policy\n         that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other\n         account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the\n         following:</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different\n               account).</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy.

In that\n         scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for\n         MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to\n         assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA\n         authentication might look like the following example.</p>\n         <p>\n            <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code>\n         </p>\n         <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a>\n         in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p>\n         <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the\n            <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The\n            <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device.\n         The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device\n         produces. </p>"
