You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account.\n      To check the status of the request, do one of the following:</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>Use the <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to provide as a\n          parameter to the <a>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</a> operation.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event.

The account in the commercial Region is\n      automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts\n      are associated with the same email address.</p>\n         <p>A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the master\n      account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US)\n      account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A\n      role is created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account.
