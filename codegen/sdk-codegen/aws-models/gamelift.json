This operation is called from a\n            game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a\n            new game session.

If\n            the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to\n            unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time\n            period is a fixed value and is not configurable.</p>\n        <p>If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following\n            cases:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>If the game server utilization status is <code>UTILIZED</code>.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <p>If the game server claim status is <code>CLAIMED</code>.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <note>\n            <p>When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game\n                server is running on an instance in <code>DRAINING</code> status.

For example, you might use an\n                    expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30\n                    seconds.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>"

        "smithy.api#documentation": "<p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to\n            automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling\n            policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's\n            capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:\n            target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage\n            fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you\n            need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p>\n        <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you\n            can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both.\n            We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have\n            unintended consequences.</p>\n        <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html\">Set Up Fleet Automatic\n                Scaling</a>.</p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Target-based policy</b>\n         </p>\n        <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This\n            metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions\n            but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional\n            player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based\n            policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is\n            needed to maintain that target. </p>\n        <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the\n            capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action\n            whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions.\n            Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10%\n            buffer. </p>\n        <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the\n            policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions)\n            and reference a <code>TargetConfiguration</code> object with your desired buffer value.\n            Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The\n            scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the\n            fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force\n            once the fleet actions are restarted.</p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Rule-based policy</b>\n         </p>\n        <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and\n            specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you\n            can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale\n            up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p>\n        <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle\n            instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity\n            by 10%.\"</p>\n        <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p>\n        <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code>\n            <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then\n                <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p>\n        <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p>\n        <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code>\n            <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then\n                <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p>\n        <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet\n            ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy\n            rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies\n            are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's\n            auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the\n            fleet actions are restarted.</p>"

FlexMatch uses\n            this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the\n            original match requirements. </p>\n        <p>When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from\n            a client service by calling this operation with a <code>GameSessions</code> ID. You also\n            have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response\n            to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the\n                <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game\n            server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started.\n            Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent\n            request automatically replaces the earlier request.</p>\n        <p>When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this\n            operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking\n            results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game\n            session that is being backfilled.</p>\n        <p>To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking\n            configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being\n            backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a match\n            backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of\n            backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.</p>\n        <p>Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match backfill.</p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Learn more</b>\n         </p>\n        <p>\n            <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html\">\n                Backfill existing games with FlexMatch</a>\n         </p>\n        <p>\n            <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html\">\n                Matchmaking events</a> (reference)</p>\n        <p>\n            <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/gamelift-match.html\">\n                How GameLift FlexMatch works</a>\n         </p>"

You can track a fleet's current\n            capacity by calling <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetCapacity.html\">DescribeFleetCapacity</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetLocationCapacity.html\">DescribeFleetLocationCapacity</a>. If the requested desired instance count is\n            higher than the instance type's limit, the <code>LimitExceeded</code> exception\n            occurs.</p> \n         <p>\n            <b>Learn more</b>\n         </p> \n         <p>\n            <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-manage-capacity.html\">Scaling fleet\n                capacity</a>\n         </p>"
