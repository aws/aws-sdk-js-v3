To fix this error, create a\n          cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your custom key store. (This process\n          creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.)

This prevents KMS from rotating the\n            <code>kmsuser</code> account password and logging into the cluster.

However, it cannot decrypt symmetric\n      ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/\">Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>.\n      These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.</p>\n         <p>If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the\n        <code>KeyId</code> parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that\n      it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation\n      by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even\n      if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is always recommended as\n      a best practice. When you use the <code>KeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS\n      only uses the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key,\n      the <code>Decrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that\n      you intend.</p>\n         <p>Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the\n        <code>Decrypt</code> operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using IAM policies.\n      Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user <code>Decrypt</code>\n      permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys\n      in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it. If you must use\n      an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code> permissions, limit the user to particular KMS keys or\n      particular trusted accounts.

You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be\n      decrypted.

This guide describes\n      the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS,\n      see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/\">\n               <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>\n            </a>.</p>\n         <note>\n            <p>KMS has replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p>\n            <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming\n        languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a\n        convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example,\n        the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and\n        retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to\n        download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web\n          Services</a>.</p>\n         </note>\n         <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p>\n         <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with\n      Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the\n      available FIPS endpoints, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region\">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of\n      the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>\n         <p>All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security\n      (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also\n      support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman\n      (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7\n      and later support these modes.</p>\n         <p>\n            <b>Signing Requests</b>\n         </p>\n         <p>Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly\n      recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your Amazon Web Services account (root) access key ID and\n      secret access key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret\n      access key for an IAM user. You can also use the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to generate\n      temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.</p>\n         <p>All KMS operations require <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4</a>.</p>\n         <p>\n            <b>Logging API Requests</b>\n         </p>\n         <p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your\n      Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the\n      information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made\n      the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it\n      on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/\">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>\n         <p>\n            <b>Additional Resources</b>\n         </p>\n         <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html\">Amazon Web Services\n            Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types\n          of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary\n            Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i>\n          describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version\n            4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing\n          a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <p>\n            <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b>\n         </p>\n         <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful\n      for most applications.
