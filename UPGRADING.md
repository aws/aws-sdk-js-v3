# Upgrading Notes (2.x to 3.x)

This document captures notable changes from AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 to v3.
The v3 is also known as modular AWS SDK for JavaScript.

Because v3 is a modular rewrite of v2, some basic conceptions are different between v2 and v3. You can learn about
these changes in our [blog posts](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/category/developer-tools/aws-sdk-for-javascript-in-node-js/).
The following blog posts will get you up to speed:

- [Modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)
- [Introducing Middleware Stack in Modular AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/first-class-typescript-support-in-modular-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)

The summary of interface changes from AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 to v3 is given below.
The goal is to help you easily find the v3 equivalents of the v2 APIs you are already familiar with.

## Client Constructors

This list is indexed by [v2 config parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html). For
options shown as `Planned` in v3, they will be supported but no timeline can be shared at the moment. They
might not have the same name either.

- [`computeChecksums`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#computeChecksums-property)
  - **v2**: Whether to compute MD5 checksums for payload bodies when the service accepts it (currently supported in S3
    only).
  - **v3**: Not available. Planned.
- [`convertResponseTypes`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#convertResponseTypes-property)
  - **v2**: Whether types are converted when parsing response data.
  - **v3**: **Deprecated**. This option is considered not type-safe because it doesn't convert the types like time stamp
    or base64 binaries from the JSON response.
- [`correctClockSkew`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#correctClockSkew-property)
  - **v2**: Whether to apply a clock skew correction and retry requests that fail because of an skewed client
    clock.
  - **v3**: **Deprecated**. SDK _always_ applies a clock skew correction.
- [`systemClockOffset`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#systemClockOffset-property)
  - **v2**: An offset value in milliseconds to apply to all signing times.
  - **v3**: No change.
- [`credentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#credentials-property)
  - **v2**: The AWS credentials to sign requests with.
  - **v3**: No change. It can also be an async function that returns credentials.
    See [v3 reference for AwsAuthInputConfig credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/interfaces/_aws_sdk_middleware_signing.awsauthinputconfig-1.html#credentials).
- [`endpointCacheSize`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#endpointCacheSize-property)
  - **v2**: The size of the global cache storing endpoints from endpoint discovery operations.
  - **v3**: Not available. Planned. This option configures endpoint discovery behavior, which is not yet available in v3.
- [`endpointDiscoveryEnabled`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#endpointDiscoveryEnabled-property)
  - **v2**: Whether to call operations with endpoints given by service dynamically.
  - **v3**: Not available. Planned. This option configures endpoint discovery behavior, which is not yet available in v3.
- [`hostPrefixEnabled`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#hostPrefixEnabled-property)
  - **v2**: Whether to marshal request parameters to the prefix of hostname.
  - **v3**: **Deprecated**. SDK _always_ injects the hostname prefix when necessary.
- [`httpOptions`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#httpOptions-property)

  A set of options to pass to the low-level HTTP request. These options are aggregated differently in v3. You can
  configure them by supplying a new `requestHandler`. Here's the example of setting http options in Node.js runtime. You
  can find more in [v3 reference for NodeHttpHandler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/classes/_aws_sdk_node_http_handler.nodehttphandler-1.html).

  All v3 requests use HTTPS by default. You only need to provide custom httpsAgent.

  ```javascript
  const { Agent } = require("https");
  const { Agent: HttpAgnet } = require("http");
  const { NodeHttpHandler } = require("@aws-sdk/node-http-handler");
  const dynamodbClient = new DynamoDBClient({
    requestHandler: new NodeHttpHandler({
      httpsAgent: new Agent({
        /*params*/
      }),
      connectionTimeout: /*number in milliseconds*/
      socketTimeout: /*number in milliseconds*/
    }),
  });
  ```

  If you are passing custom endpoint which uses http, then you need to provide httpAgent.

  ```javascript
  const { Agent } = require("http");
  const { NodeHttpHandler } = require("@aws-sdk/node-http-handler");

  const dynamodbClient = new DynamoDBClient({
    requestHandler: new NodeHttpHandler({
      httpAgent: new Agent({
        /*params*/
      }),
    }),
    endpoint: "http://example.com",
  });
  ```

  If the client is running in browsers, a different set of options is available. You can find more in [v3
  reference for FetchHttpHandler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/classes/_aws_sdk_fetch_http_handler.fetchhttphandler-1.html).

  ```javascript
  const { FetchHttpHandler } = require("@aws-sdk/fetch-http-handler");
  const dynamodbClient = new DynamoDBClient({
    requestHandler: new FetchHttpHandler({
      requestTimeout: /*number in milliseconds*/
    }),
  });
  ```

  Each option of `httpOptions` is specified below:

  - `proxy`
    - **v2**: The URL to proxy requests through
    - **v3**: You can set up a proxy with an agent following [Configuring proxies for Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/node-configuring-proxies.html)
  - `agent`

    - **v2**: The Agent object to perform HTTP requests with. Used for connection pooling.
    - **v3**: You can configure `httpAgent` or `httpsAgent` as shown in the examples above.

  - `connectionTimeout`
    - **v2**: Sets the socket to timeout after failing to establish a connection with the server after connectTimeout
      milliseconds.
    - **v3**: `connectionTimeout` is available [in `NodeHttpHandler` options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/classes/_aws_sdk_node_http_handler.nodehttphandler-1.html).
  - `timeout`
    - **v2**: The number of milliseconds a request can take before automatically being terminated.
    - **v3**: Hard request timeout is not available in `NodeHttpHandler`, but available as `requestTimeout` [in

  - `xhrAsync`
    - **v2**: Whether the SDK will send asynchronous HTTP requests.
    - **v3**: **Deprecated**. Requests are _always_ asynchronous.
  - `xhrWithCredentials`
    - **v2**: Sets the "withCredentials" property of an XMLHttpRequest object.

## S3 Multipart Upload

In v2, the S3 client contains an [`upload()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#upload-property)
operation that supports uploading large objects with [multipart upload feature offered by S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html).

In v3, [`@aws-sdk/lib-storage` package](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/blob/main/lib/lib-storage) is available.
It supports all the features offered in v2 `upload()`, and supports both Node.js and browsers runtime.

## S3 Presigned URL

In v2, the S3 client contains [`getSignedUrl()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrl-property)
and [`getSignedUrlPromise()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrlPromise-property)
operations to generate an URL that users can use to upload or download objects from S3.

In v3, [`@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` package](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/tree/main/packages/s3-request-presigner)
is available. You don't have to differentiate `getSignedUrl()` and `getSignedUrlPromise()` any more. We also have [a blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/generate-presigned-url-modular-aws-sdk-javascript/)
discussing the details of this package.
