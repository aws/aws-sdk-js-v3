/**
 * Integration tests are tests that require multiple units or packages,
 * and do not connect to live services.
 * These should be run with the yarn test:integration script in each package.
 * For tests that involve network requests to live services, see jest.config.e2e.js.
 *
 * The "test:integration:legacy" tests run with cucumber-js should be considered
 * E2E tests in this classification system.
