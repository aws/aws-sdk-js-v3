# @aws-sdk/aws-client-api-test

This is not a runtime or published package.

This is a test spec.

The purpose of this package is to stabilize the `@aws-sdk/client-*` interface against changes.

If tests in this package fail, the author should either fix their changes such that the API contract
is maintained, or appropriately announce and safely deprecate the interfaces affected by incoming changes.
