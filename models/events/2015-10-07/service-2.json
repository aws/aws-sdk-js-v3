However, CloudWatch Events uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.</p> <p>In CloudWatch Events, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.</p> <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. </p> <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.</p> <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions.

For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>.

To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged.
