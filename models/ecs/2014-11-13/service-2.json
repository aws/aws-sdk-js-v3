If the number of tasks running in a service drops below <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html\">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a deployment, the service scheduler uses the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code> parameters to determine the deployment strategy. The deployment is triggered by changing the task definition or the desired count of a service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation.</p> <p>The <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> represents a lower limit on the number of your service's tasks that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the <code>desiredCount</code> (rounded up to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks and a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50%, the scheduler can stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 50% in the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs and 50% for the console.</p> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of your service's tasks that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the <code>desiredCount</code> (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your replica service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks and a <code>maximumPercent</code> value of 200%, the scheduler can start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for a replica service for <code>maximumPercent</code> is 200%. If you are using a daemon service type, the <code>maximumPercent</code> should remain at 100%, which is the default value.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code> parameter):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

When you specify an IAM role for a task, its containers can then use the latest versions of the AWS CLI or SDKs to make API requests to the AWS services that are specified in the IAM policy associated with the role. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html\">IAM Roles for Tasks</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can specify a Docker networking mode for the containers in your task definition with the <code>networkMode</code> parameter. The available network modes correspond to those described in <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/network-settings\">Network settings</a> in the Docker run reference. If you specify the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a <a>NetworkConfiguration</a> when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.
