You can use the\n      Connections API to work with connections and installations.</p>\n         <p>\n            <i>Connections</i> are configurations that you use to connect AWS\n      resources to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be given to\n      services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For\n      example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a\n      code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and\n      associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.</p>\n         <p>When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake.\n        <i>Installations</i> are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For\n      example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket Cloud app. When you\n      create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one.</p>\n         <p>You can work with connections by calling:</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <a>CreateConnection</a>, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be\n          referenced by services such as CodePipeline.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <a>DeleteConnection</a>, which deletes the specified connection.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <a>GetConnection</a>, which returns information about the connection, including\n          the connection status.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <a>ListConnections</a>, which lists the connections associated with your\n          account.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <p>For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Connections, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">AWS CodePipeline User\n        Guide</a>.</p>",
